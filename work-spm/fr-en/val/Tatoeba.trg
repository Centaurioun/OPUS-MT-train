I want you to tell me why you did that.
Are you sure you've never met him?
I love all of you.
I want us to tell the truth to each other.
I wonder how they're going to react.
I can't help anyone.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
I've never seen you like this.
This is the shortest way to the station.
Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it.
I was hungry.
Are you all set to leave?
It has to be subtitled.
Tom can go with you if he likes.
This guy is an outlaw.
I love a challenge.
He may have missed the train.
You have to do this whether you like it or not.
I couldn't look at it any longer.
You're very astute.
Thank you for your letter.

Control yourself!
Bananas are a good source of potassium.
Who's this message for?
You have many books.
Don't speak so fast.
I should be happy.
Do you have plans tonight?
I wanted to help you.
Tom confuses his right with his left.
I think you should stop giving Tom money.
Is that too expensive for you?
Why wouldn't you let me go to Tom's party?
After dinner, bring your guitar along and we'll sing.
It's raining buckets outside.
I burnt myself on the leg.
We're young.
The crowd filled the streets.
These are the steps that lead straight to failure.

That's the problem, I think.
I spent the weekend with my grandma.
I'm surprised that you're so na√Øve.
You might want to have someone look into that matter.
We caught him red-handed.
How many kilos may I take?

We're getting out of here. The storm is coming.
Remove the bandage.
Tom's dog is well-trained.
What are you hiding?

I apologize to all of you.
I hope everyone is happy.

Why don't you take the cat out with you?
She is loved by everybody.
You should have told me the truth.
Don't pay it any heed.
It's very interesting.

I don't want you to be upset.
May your soul rest in peace.
This one is for us.
What's the point of your question?
Why don't we do this later?
I am given a monthly allowance of fifty thousand yen.
