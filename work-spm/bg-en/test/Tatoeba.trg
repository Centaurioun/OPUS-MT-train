Aren't you Tom?
I have the list.
It's for the children.
I think you're making a big mistake.
Yes. That's right.
I'm being patient.
Let's ask him.
What country were you born in?
There was a fire in this city last night. We can't tell exactly what time it broke out.
Don't you have anything else?
I owe him 50,000 yen.
How do you spell that word?
After her husband died, her baby was all in all to her.
Don't go through the lobby.
The buses ran back and forth almost empty.

She's asking how that's possible.
I'll come provided you drive slowly.
Speak clearly.
Don't you think that all our politicians are too old?
It's fifty kilometers to Paris.
I think we both know why I'm here.
Tom frowned.
Judging by that great tan, it looks like you spent most of your vacation on the beach.
You are always complaining.
It looks like your dog is thirsty.
Let me go alone.
How much money do you have?
I'd never hurt him.
I could make you happy.
This isn't fun.
It looks like you did a pretty good job.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
Their wedding is tomorrow.
Hang up your coat, please.
I've seen Tom here before.
Are you sure?
I hear Tom stole a car.
Do you like to travel?
Do you have to go to the post office?
Do you have an elevator in your house?
Tom kissed Mary goodbye.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I think you'd remember that.
Don't take anything for granted.
Tom screwed in the light bulb.
We will only consent on that condition.
Did you accept his invitation?
My dizziness still hasn't gone away.
Tom seems really happy.
I'm sorry.
I think Tom is awake.
We've had our problems.
Where's the dog?
How do you know?
Be sure to complete the work before you go home.
I've seen Tom do some amazing things.
After the conversation ends, he says a friendly goodbye and wishes me a pleasant evening.
Ask me anything.
I'll get you more.
I haven't seen you around here before.
I think Tom looks like John.
You always sing.
We're eating breakfast inside.
Turn in your homework.
He's a creationist.
I'm looking for you.
This is all Tom has to do.
I heard it might snow.
He's out taking a walk.
Where is Paris?
What's your favorite cartoon?
Have you met her before?
I only speak a little French.
Tom can't stand up.
Your French is improving.
Go away.
The chair is too small.
Old people need something to live for.
I don't remember mailing the letter.
Is there any water in the pot?
The only thing you need to do is go there.
Button up your overcoat.
Did you watch the game?
Tom just wanted to be neighborly.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
What's your last name, Tom?
I wonder if Tom's parents will allow him to go with us.
Let's end this debate.
Watch me closely.
I can't stand his arrogance.
He looked over my report.
Let's work.
Did anyone tell you?
Are you involved?
I think you're capable of anything.
I have some things for Tom.
I don't have much money.
Can't you speak English?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
He is too tired to study.
I don't have any demands.
I feel sick whenever I see blood.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Be careful not to slip.
Tom can't stand you.
How old are your cousins?
I'm not being paid enough.
That river is wide.
I think you're the one who needs help.
I've seen what Tom can do.
Wake up, Tom.
I don't gamble anymore.
Don't let me fall asleep.
You alone can help me.
Wine is the milk of old men.
That's very big.
Aren't you glad Tom gave us enough money to buy something to eat?
Well prepared means no worries.
You could have done it.
Einstein loved playing the violin.
I know only this.
I run every day.
This just has to be Tom's hat.
I wasn't told that.
The snow has disappeared.
I've always wanted to study French.

Tom is young, isn't he?
Go and look for Tom.
I've taken everything into consideration.
Is there something I'm missing here?
I have some things to do.
I can't understand his feelings.
All men are brothers.
Tell me about Tom.
Be more careful. You often leave out some letter or other.
He took a week off.
I think we could help each other.
If there is anything you want, don't hesitate to ask me.
Many people uphold the stance that 95% of DNA is junk.
I'm serious.
Can I turn on the TV?
If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it.
It is convenient for us to start now.
I'm afraid it won't work.
A bicycle will rust if you leave it in the rain.
A terrible fate awaited him.
How long are you going for?
Be careful, there's a car!
Tom won't be back for a week.
I have something special for you.
It is six years since I started to study English.
You can improve your English if you try.
Why did you come this early?
Some of the company's executives are out of town for a conference.
I wouldn't blame you.
Let's not go.
I think you should find out where Tom went.
I'll leave tonight.
You are wearing your socks inside out.
The fever has abated.
You must study hard.
Give me something to eat.
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple.
What did she do today?
I haven't used French in a long time and I've forgotten a lot of words.
I wash my socks.
Christmas is soon, right?
That's quite another thing.
What's the minimum salary in the United Kingdom?
Well, let's talk turkey.

Driving too fast is dangerous.
She scarcely goes out except on business.
