Maybe they have something.

He's able to speak Japanese.
I won't be able to visit for a while.
He's the one who heads the marketing of the perfumes line.
This is my business card.
He acted as my guide.
To do him justice, he is not idle.

Ask Tom.

Do any of you know Tom?
I'm going to study French next semester.
It turned out well.
I'm against it.
Can't we do anything?
I feel as if I've known Tom for years.
Why do people add simple and common sentences such as "hello," "how are you," etc.?
Our guests should be here within an hour.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
Speaking French is very difficult for me.
You are carrying your joke a bit too far.
I've seen you before.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
My living expense is rising year by year.

I'll come with Tom.
For what purpose?

I'm hoping that that'll happen.
He gave me a curt answer.
I heard an unusual sound.
Have you ever noticed that Tom's right ear is much larger than his left ear?
I picked you some flowers.
Tom doesn't often make mistakes.
What's the secret?
He didn't say a word.
I thought you'd be happy.
I think you should leave now.
He's doing well.
I don't condone murder.
It won't be the first time that Tom's been late.

I think Tom wants our help.
She gave us a vague answer.
I'll go by myself.
Barbara was killed by Alister.
I heard Tom was hurt.

Be careful not to slip!
I can't speak English, much less German.
Who cares about me?
Four people were in the car when the accident happened.
The fog prevented him from seeing very far ahead.
Good afternoon.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
Darn it, I forgot my camera!
He is alive with enthusiasm.
I haven't seen anything.
He is of average height.
There was no budging him.
I heard every word you said.
I don't know what that is.
Why don't you follow me?
I'm not sure yet.
I'm angry with you.
How about taking a rest?
You ruined everything.
Does Tom study French every day?
Welcome home.
What would you like?
Could I have these clothes ironed?
It didn't look that easy.

Let's go to the circus tomorrow.
Does Tom know why you weren't at his party?
How tall you are!
I have work for Tom.
I haven't seen Tom in days.
They were prohibited from leaving the hotel.
I can understand this problem to some extent.
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Be careful.
Let me go alone.
Wait until your father gets home.
I know her very well.

Did your parents or other members of your family like to read?
Are you busy doing something?
I'm going to go through with it in spite of her opposition.

Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died.
He coaxed extra money from his mother.

I can't live without you.
She declined the invitation.

As such is the case, I am sorry I can't accept your kind invitation.
I hear a phone ringing.
I have just eaten lunch.
Speaking French is a lot of fun.
I think Tom might feel the same way you do.
I don't think that he's honest.
Don't go near that!
My screw gun is making weird noises.
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
That dude was a jerk.
Tom watched a Japanese movie subtitled in French.
She turned down his invitation.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
We mustn't give way to these impudent demands.
We always work together.
Tom's eyes are open.
He got 90% in English.
Thank you for breakfast.
You're sitting in my seat.
I would never question his honesty.
It is a six hours' drive from Sofia to Varna.
Diligence enabled him to succeed.
I think you've had too much to drink.
Do you plan to join us for a drink afterwards?
You shall want for nothing as long as I live.
I have something special for you.
All I want to do is go fishing.
Could you wait outside?
I'm starting to like you.
Can you pay me in advance?
I can't buy you that dress.
In one letter he remarks, "Life is but a dream."
This just has to be Tom's hat.
I should congratulate you.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
Tom couldn't make it.
It's been decided.
I forgot to wear a belt.
I heard that story.
How lucky you are!
Let's give it one more try.
Nothing interesting happens in this small town.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
Why do you want to become a nurse?
My friends call me Ken.
I gave up all hope of survival.
You'll see it.
You look very tired.
He's a baseball player.
I forgot her name.
This coat is rainproof.
Which way is the beach?
Bring him along.
Are you scared?
If you need help, just ask.
I wish I could have spoken French.
Don't let me fall asleep.
Would you mind if I came along?
She was promoted.
He has just become a principal.
Prices have dropped recently.
I'm in a hurry today.
I'm afraid it won't work.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
There's been an accident.
I was really confused.
He said he did not enter the room, which was a lie.
It looks like you changed the whole room.
He is not going to get ahead.
I think you'll be pleased.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
"What make is your car?" "It is a Ford."
It was beginning to snow.
That's why you pay us.
A gang of thieves broke into the bank.
I thought I'd say hello to Tom.
All I want is a washing machine.
No matter what, don't tell Tom.
I hope it's good.
I won't tell anyone.
That's a nice story.
Odd, isn't it? We should have already arrived.
Aren't you happy?
Tom is not cut out to be a teacher.
Do you sell French newspapers?
I interpreted your silence as consent.
How did you come to hear that?
London was bombed several times.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Tom was sick of his job.
He often quotes Milton.
You're so weird.
Can you ride a horse?
I think about that from time to time.
He thinks nothing of staying up all night.
I have to trust Tom.
How long did you stay?
Tom is still unemployed.
I really don't think that'll be necessary.
I think you should pick Tom.
I hate my roommate.
Just go to your room.
I majored in chemistry at the university.
I've forgotten.
Christmas is December 25th.
I think you'll be pleased.
No one speaks with me.
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
Are you nervous?
I've never won anything in my life.
I like tennis and golf.
I couldn't make myself understood in French.
Labor is not merely a necessity but a pleasure.
Tom should be given the death penalty.
He is faced with a difficult problem.
We're like brothers.
I like sports.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Dick had a traffic accident.
I don't get jealous.
I don't deny that.
They call me Bob.
The people here are good.
Tom's French is quite good.
Is that our problem?
You have to be patient.
The snow was knee deep.
I won't waste my time.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
We would like to eat. Could you serve us expressly? We need to be on our way before half past one.
Kids constantly fighting in the back seat of the car doesn't make for a pleasant trip.
I visited my grandmother's house.
No, I'm not singing.
They're surrounding us.
I think you'll be impressed.
She resented being called a coward.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
You must know you're faced with a crisis.
Do you think it'll rain today?
I swim once a week.
We made fun of him about this.
Don't let me die here.
I think you need someone to talk to.
Are you interested?
I have no idea.
The weather is sunny.
Are you worried?
Tom went for a drive.
Are they confused?
That won't help you.
I'm glad to make your acquaintance.
I intend to study abroad next year.
Come on, baby, fight my liar!
Try on that shirt.
She has beautiful handwriting.
You're an artist.
Every day we use many things which Edison invented.
Why aren't you here?
I'm glad that they fixed the heating system, but now it's too hot.
Are you armed?
Don't change sentences that are correct. You can, instead, submit natural-sounding alternative translations.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
My car's in the garage.
You gave me only fifty cents.
I have something I need to tell you.
I heard you cheering.
It's healthy to breathe deeply.
I'll soon register for a course in German.
Are you sure you really want to do that?
I'm so embarrassed.
You must control yourself.
I've never seen anything quite like this before.
I don't want to grow up.
I have three young kids.
Now it's your serve.
My stomach is clenched with hunger.
I couldn't find his house.
Don't get me flowers anymore.
This desk cost me 20,000 yen.
I've seen Tom at work.
We can't live on 150,000 yen a month.
The knife is dull.
I was busy yesterday.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
She is giving a party tonight.
Tom isn't my assistant.
It happened.
Why can't I go to Tom's party?
We learn French at school.
I won't see her again.
Don't make any sudden moves.
I count to ten.
Tom will hear you.
I thought Tom might be sick.
Tom is a real nerd.
So what did you think?
Tom can speak French and English.
She's popular, not because she's beautiful, but because she's kind to everyone.
Ken studied English last night.
Ann finished painting the picture.
We can't postpone the meeting.
I really don't know what to say.
Do you have any soup bowls?
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
He eats nothing but fruit.
We were compelled to put off our departure.
Mary is a museum curator.
Stay in there.
Tom likes cats.
I will meet him at the bus stop.
What did she say?
Was it a nice trip?
You'd better not go.
When I tell you 'jump', you jump!
Tom and John are brothers.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
May I borrow your car?
I prefer tea to coffee.
I've seen you someplace.
Tom turned the light back on.
I fell asleep while reading a book.
Well, let's go.
Are the Giants playing tonight?
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Their lifestyle is different from ours.
You should have the test done again. The result may have been a false positive.
Please don't do it.
For one thing, I've no money, and for another, I've no leisure.
Aren't you in charge?
I told her once and for all that I wouldn't go shopping with her.
Please call me whenever it is convenient to you.
Tell Tom why.
I have to get dressed now.
How was your weekend?
I've lost my ticket.
No doubt he will come.
I play a little guitar.
I'll give you five dollars.
What's the weather like today?
Well, I'll be damned!
I think Tom may be telling the truth.
Apparently it worked.
He got engaged to my cousin.
Alas, I was late.
Please begin immediately.
He looks like his father.
I have to get some money.
Darn!
I love parties.
How about playing chess tonight?
You don't get up as early as your sister.
My wife told me to throw this old hat away.
Don't make me say it.
I was late for school this morning.
Are you happy?
You are very brave.
You cannot be serious.
We were supposed to meet at the restaurant, but Tom never showed up.
What are your weekend plans?
I think that's the right thing to do.
He burnt his hand on the hot stove.
Tom heard something.
It looks like the second floor is a banquet hall.
Tom sat on the side of his bed and pulled on his socks.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
Mary told John the secret.
Mary wants a dozen eggs.
Aren't you enjoying yourself?
Take care not to drop that glass.
I want to buy a new camera.
Further testing is needed.
Alice may possibly come.
I was afraid I might be late.
He greeted that lady.
Can't you vacuum later?
I attended the meeting yesterday.
It looks like it's going to snow.
He overslept this morning.
I'm not going unless Tom goes.
Tom is good at French.
That's a photo of my sister.
Why do I still listen to this?
Do you want to try it?
He gets tired easily.
I'll do it again.
Tom is so rude.
You may go.
I am nearly as tall as she.
I forgot to sent her an email.
Some animals can sense the coming of a storm.
Are you registered?
I own 30 acres of land about 3 miles out of town.
Don't get up too quickly.
Don't let yourself be used.
"May I park here?" "No, you can't."
Their food was great last time.
Since I'm unemployed, I can't save up anything.
You want to buy this skirt.
I think you'd better sit down.
He climbed the stairs.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
Speak!
I want to rent this room to a student.
I have to take it off.

Numerous examples can be given.
What's your story, Tom?
I don't want to get involved in that business.
The watch was not to be found anywhere.
Kate can hardly speak Chinese.
I heard you scream.
Tom didn't want Mary to go out with other guys.
You're always good.
Don't do it, Tom.
Europeans like to drink wine.
I love Hitomi.
It's not Tom's problem.
I'll walk you back to your hotel.
You're sitting in my seat.
It's pretty incredible.
I think you'd better leave.
All that I want is you!
Why am I so sleepy?
I met your father yesterday.
What is your favourite bird?
That's absolutely right.
Tom always treats me like a child.
Where in Turkey do you live?
I hope it's useful.
They're rather important.
I have a dictionary.
Although no one ever spoke about it, everyone knew that something wasn't quite right.
I wonder what Tom meant by that.
I really am glad you're here.
I'm planning to stay at a hotel.
When was that?
She disliked her husband.
Theoretically it should work.
Why do you keep saying there's ample time?
The men were all arrested.
Tom jumped back just in time.
I have to go help Tom.
I didn't speak with Tom.

Mary, what's wrong with you today?
I hope Tom wins.
Oh, I was ill.
I have to stop Tom.
I want to get off this island.
I haven't said yes yet.

Are you free this evening?
She is an atheist.
Let's play!
It was a perfect day.
Maybe I shouldn't be so suspicious.

I tipped the cabbie ten bucks for getting me to the airport on time.
Are you sure of your facts?
I can't agree with Tom.
We don't know each other.
There is no point in deluding yourself; you know it well that she's just playing games with you.
Maybe I will settle down with a woman.
Am I allowed to enter?
She went down the stairs.
At the most, the trip will cost $1,000.

There's still no sign of her.

Tom can't afford that.
May I borrow your dictionary?
I can't do it right now.
