This old house is made of wood.
You'll die out there.
I knew you'd come back.
Tom does not have friends.
Mary scared us.
I bought it from her.
What did you say? I can't hear you.
I have one thousand and five hundred cows.
We're waiting, Tom.
I can't lie to you.
These are people.
We're still here.
Tom will never give up.
I want to grow old with Mary.
Tom said Mary was his daughter.
Ken has two cats.
Could you show me the way?
Ask her yourself.
I want to come back here.
Tom ran out of water.
I heard her voice in my sleep.
Tom is taller than me.
I'm older than your brother.
Take her out of here.
I'm twelve years old.
Do you like fish?
We'll come back.
I didn't understand the joke.
He is about to leave.
We'll catch Tom.
Let's take Tom with us.
Tom likes singing.
She went home and cried.
I'm not dead, am I?
I'm hungry. How about you?
It's been ten years since my father died.
We're going.
Tom only saw Mary once.
I want to try riding a horse.
He saw nobody.
Mom, I'm hungry.
Tom looked inside.
He blinked.
We will rescue them.
The next day he went away.
She has green eyes.
She is sick.
It wasn't good.
We stole it.
I will find you, Charley.
Are you gonna kill me?
They're expecting you.
Tom didn't see you.
The sky is getting dark.
The dog is yours.
Why is your mouth open?
Mary is screaming.
Tom works nights.
I can count to a hundred.
Tom said he'd be here.
Didn't you hear him?
I don't work today.
He kissed the back of her hand.
Why don't you talk to us now?
I can't do anything like that.
I'll never forget what you did.
If I want, they will kill you.
Few people speak my language.
I don't feel at all tired.
Who came here?
Hanni and Nanni are twins.
I hope you don't get lost.
I saw her just the other day.
We'll be killed.
Why did they do it?
Tom isn't hungry.
That was them.
This is a woman.
Emily's home.
This is the house.
Stop, I say.
What? You can't do it? You coward! Chicken!
Tom told me you were here.
That reminded me of you.
Will you come back tomorrow?
"Do you understand?" "No, I don't."
He threw a stone at the big dog.
We'll go out.
My name is Maria Sara.
I did it.
Wait. I want to show you something.
She has husband and two daughters.
We'll finish later.
She likes these cats.
Don't walk on other people's land.
Tom will protect you.
I want to go home and sleep.
Can any of you tell me where Tom is?
Mary's shoes are dirty.
Nobody understood me.
No one will come.
The cat which you found is mine.
What are we here for?
She looks well. She looks good.
He has green eyes.
We're buying.
Did you see it?
We'll find her.
Our grandfather is ill.
Where did you see the boy?
I heard his voice in my sleep.
No one suspected him.
She asked me: "Who arrived first?"
I saw them crying.
Can we talk tomorrow?
The girl walked slowly.
What do you think Tom will do?
He will bring Tom.
I'm taking it to her.
Tom isn't like you.
You can sit here.
If you don't do that, you will be a dead man.
Will you go with her?
Get it out of here.
No one can stop me now.
Now I don't know what to do.
I am not hungry.
What do you do here?
Dan is my new friend.
Who kissed her?
Is your wife home?
Do you study or work?
We can end it.
You or I?
I like children.
Take either of the apples.
Tom will stop you.
He will soon come back.
We'll be together.
My knife is broken.
You're in the right place.
I sent Tom back home.
We'll work.
Last night, I didn't sleep.
I didn't sleep.
Don't go out because it is cold.
He has holes in his clothes.
Which house is his?
Why don't you be quiet and listen?
You tricked me.
We can't all be like you.
My grandmother cannot see.
Get me up at eight.
I want you to come with us tonight.
Go talk to them.
I like all languages.
I'm twenty-seven years old.
Nobody knew where he went.
Where did you take your shoes off?
Who is this woman?
They found Mary.
We want you here.
Tom is your son, not mine.
The horse is white.
Tom saw it.
You don't remember?
There was no one home.
Can you come back on Monday?
Tom has gone away.
Tom's asleep.
I am talking with Tom.
I talked to him again.
Mary has a headache.
The tree throws a shadow on the grass.
Do not speak for others.
You missed me, didn't you?
Right - clear, left - clear..., OK, all clear.
I don't want to go near her.
We don't know what Tom said.
I own one cat.
Are all of them your friends?
He didn't tell me his name.
The cat is not mine.
Is somebody there?
You look tired. You must have been working too hard.
Tom's married.
Are you going to stay with us?
I don't want you to stay.
Nobody can stop him.
Has anything changed?
I was late for work.
Did you do this all yourself?
I'll tell you what I want to do.
Tom and I will help you.
Go to sleep now.
We never talk.
She can't love you.
I drink.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
The cat got through the hedge.
They want it back.
Where does he want to go?
She said to me, "Who arrived first?"
Wait for me next to that tree.
Someone has died.
I told her we were friends.
I've done this.
You saw a mouse, didn't you?
This reminds me of her.
It will grow old.
Come back and see us again.
I want him to be arrested.
They just taught me to swear.
I'm so hungry that I could eat a horse.
The children will be happy.
Go tell him yourself.
His son died last year.
We're eating dinner right now.
Keep your hands off me.
No one laughed.
Come and sit over here.
I'm here, too.
Tom is short and fat.
I like to swim.
It's expensive.
Nothing can stop him.
What did you say yesterday?
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
What's going to happen today?
Analyn sold the cow.
No one asked you.
Do you want to do this?
Is it true? Paul kissed Lily on the lips?
Don't swim here.
I didn't want to kill him.
Don't be frightened.
We heard the door closing.
The village was silent.
We'll find one.
I hope you'll get well soon.
Two brothers went to travel together.
I don't speak to Tom.
Do you think it'll rain today?
Don't worry. I'll look after your dog for you.
I think I'm going to get fired.
I bought them for you.
I will give you anything you want.
What are they saying?
What's this dog's name?
They could not swim.
Tom went first.
We missed you.
My mommy went outside.
The best mirror is an old friend.
I told him we were friends.
This is a nice place.
The boy and the man are drinking water.
I ate with my parents.
Tom is a friend of my friend's.
This door won't shut.
Don't you remember?
I can't wait until tomorrow.
I'm ashamed to go out dressed like this.
Tom was hungry.
If I want, they will kill her.
I want to find him.
I forgot you don't like carrots.
Tom wanted to sell it.
I didn't kill those guys.
He will not come today.
The house was silent.
Have you ever milked a cow?
