Please drive slowly.
We're finished.
Don't move till I get back.
Tom smelled it.
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
I'll be seventeen next year.
I miss you too!
According to me we can do that.
Let's end this.
Wait for me, I am coming.
Come get it.
Why did Tom leave Boston?
Tom, where are you? Everyone's looking for you!
You are taller than I.
I told him what you did.
I don't want to do anything tonight.
It's very cheap.
The wolves are near us.
Tom! How nice to see you again!
I didn't forget about you, Tom.
Let's get them out of there.
We'll catch up.
I don't like Tom at all.
I love you.
How old is your uncle?
Did you buy him a dog?
I came here with him.
What are we looking for?
His dream came true.
It's a game for children.
My father is so old that he can't work.
It is just noon.
She held my arm firmly.
Tom, don't listen to them!
Do you have dinner plans?
I'm taking you with me.
Did I hurt you?
I'm only joking.
Nobody wants to come.
That's not Tom.
Mary knows that.
I haven't told Tom.
I want to know why you're doing this.
They are eating their apples.
Tom will be home soon.
Tom was a nice man.
What the heart thinks, the mouth speaks.
I didn't recognize him.
I think we can catch him.
Hey, don't stop now.
They're not jealous.
I'm going to do it.
Have we forgotten anything?
I'm not fat.
I can't see you.
Good evening!
She saved us all.
I brought some friends with me.
We can protect you.
Dick says, "I can swim."
Where is it that Tom wants to go?
They didn't say that.
He left this.
I gave Tom a hug.
We saw you come in.
Tell me that was a joke!
Owls are active at night.
Here comes Tom now.
How many people still speak your language?
They were scared.
Stay away from this.
Tom killed himself three months ago.
This is a man.
I didn't go with her.
She is not jealous.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
We aren't alone.
Tom didn't buy anything.
Your father is tall.
We heard.
One day, we will understand.
Has Tom returned?
We'll be neighbors.
I know this.
Sleep well, Timmy.
Who did this first?
How old is your dog?
Where does your wife work?
Tell them I'll be back.
Do you know whether Tom is married or single?
Do I know Tom?
How did you come to hear of it?
Tell her I'm hungry.
Tom was full.
I'm going out today.
Why did you say that?
Go to Tom's house.
She's on her way home.
I don't want to talk to you today.
Do I look tired?
I have no kids.
I love this language.
Miriam wanted to marry Thomas.
I will stop you.
I want to bring her here.
I can hear Tom.
He wants to eat both of them.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
I never saw her before today.
He will go in your place.
I saw his daughter was crying.
I want her.
Keep still.
Let him talk.
We don't know any songs.
I've worked with them.
Wait for them.
Never tell a lie again.
He told me to speak more slowly.
Do you want me to tell you why?
Do you like your brother?
I can't do any more than this.
He was alone there.
Who is it?
Are you doing anything?
We can do this.
He looked at me and laughed.
Do you remember what she said?
I don't know how old Tom is now.
I closed my eyes and turned my head.
Did they ever find them?
That's his house.
I can't be friends with him.
Yesterday was the first day of autumn.
Tom took some food home.
Who will sing tonight?
Let somebody else do this.
No one has heard about this.
Is Tom out of his mind?
Everybody laughed at Tom.
I don't want to go near him.
We'll leave now.
Nobody said that.
He taught me everything I know.
I can't be friends with her.
I caught a fish!
Who sings in the summer, works in the winter.
This is a boy.
Stay and watch.
Tusnelda was the wife of Arminio.
What does it say?
I'll bring it to you.
Tom will soon be a father.
Tom, I'm doing this for you.
I know you're in here.
Go talk to her.
My father is two years younger than my mother is.
Tomorrow I'll turn 28.
I am not fat!
I was on the road.
Don't lie to yourself.
Mary is my wife.
Ask again later.
How hot it is today!
I've never seen her.
Is Tom hungry?
The day was hot.
We all know you.
I can go there by foot.
How did you break it?
The road goes north from here.
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
Tom arrived.
How did you know Tom was sick?
Tusnelda was Arminio's wife.
He's taller than me.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
Who is your mother?
I am too short.
Yes, I'm Tom's sister, but I'm not like him!
What were you eating?
I forgot it.
You're a beauty.
Tom's right.
Don't yell.
Do you like my clothes?
I don't have any debt.
Tom stayed there for three days.
I'm taking it to him.
We'll speak to him later.
He is afraid of the dog.
There is snow on the mountains.
"Where are you?" "I'm here!"
The sun sets.
My parents don't know.
Thanks to all of you.
Are you lying right now?
Are they big?
Tom loves to fish.
Tom was sitting there.
I remember seeing you somewhere.
Where does he work?
Take him out of here.
We'll find it.
Is that enough?
No one's here.
I'm taking this to her.
That's true too, isn't it?
We'll be late.
You can't stop them.
I couldn't make it stop.
Tom didn't laugh, did he?
They'll know what to do.
We're going out.
I think Tom is crazy.
Show me what you have got in your hand.
Look! She's coming!
They went inside.
We'll ask Tom.
Tom played with his kids.
I wanted to go there.
You had a cat.
I never saw her again.
Tom knocked him down.
Who did you get this from?
What did you say?
He will come tomorrow.
You look tired.
If it doesn't rain, let's go out.
This game is not bad.
I want her behind bars.
This one is on me.
She seems OK now.
I wash my hands before lunch.
Tom is as tall as Jack.
Close the door!
I was at home.
"Me?" "Yes, you!"
My brother Jacques is fourteen years old.
You're not my father.
Tom's not fat.
Tom says he's not hungry.
We want to speak with Tom.
You can go to sleep now.
Who are you people?
There is an apple in the boy's pocket.
I'm taking this to him.
We are both her girlfriends.
What's your wife's job?
We'll see them later.
