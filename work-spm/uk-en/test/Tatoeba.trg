It's all been written.
You told Tom to do that, didn't you?
I have been to Canada.

You need to calm down.
I'm lucky.
Is Tom going to be OK?
Tell me why.
Which is the capital of the United States, Washington or New York?
Can I have a word, please?
OK, I get the idea.
I don't get invited to parties anymore.
Mary could change her mind.
I think Tom is crazy.
Please write it down.

It will take some time before he understands it, right?
Do you know how to contact them?
I have to talk to Tom now.
The light went on.
March 14 is Pi Day.
I was here.
What time will the game start?
You can't force me to do that.
You kissed her, didn't you?
I'll give it to Tom.
Why are you so cheerful?
I wonder if I can do that.
You've got a poor memory!
Why doesn't Tom like Boston?
