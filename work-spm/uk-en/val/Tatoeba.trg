At last, they purchased freedom with blood.
It's true, isn't it?
Would you please teach Tom how to do that?
You need a good night's sleep.
I thought that he knew everything about Japan.
I don't get you.
I didn't recognize your voice.
Tom forgot where he left his umbrella.
Are you really all alone now?
I've never heard that language.
Does he have a car in Japan?
Do it now.
There is an orange on the table.
I don't have a garden.
Tom never was successful.
We never said goodbye.
Don't touch me.
Enough!
Where's the table?
I thought I'd take a chance.
I am short.
I'm so tired.
Someone has died.
John played the guitar and his friends sang.
I saw a girl with long hair.
Who doesn't like the beach?
Isn't Tom your cat?
I don't speak English.
I hope Tom doesn't know what you've done.
Tom is prepared.
Is anybody there?
I know I'm crazy.
I really can't help you.
And the people? What will they say?
Tom is only a child.
Tell me what happened.
Your room is ready.
Are you certain?
Losing my daughter has taken away my will to live.
I know that you won't do it.
This is an interesting book to read.
I shot Tom.
Did you have a fun day with Tom?
Tom has studied French, but not for long.
Tom likes to make paper airplanes.
It was a crazy game.
They wanted to punish me.
Let me give you my phone number.
I think aliens exist.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
It isn't cheap.
This year will be different.
I can wait.
Do you like Japanese food?
Check it out.
Do you plan on doing that?
I despise Tom.
Do we need a universal language?
You're a little too young for me.
The gun hadn't been fired.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice are all guilty.
I had a good idea.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't allow me to do that.
I had nowhere to go.
We're going to start doing that today.
I retired at sixty.
They're all waiting.
Your English has improved a lot.
Everyone wants to be Tom's friend.
I assumed that Tom was Mary's boyfriend.
I thought that Tom was interested in sports.
Yana fooled him.
I love Tom's eyes.
What are you shaking your head for?
The lake is polluted.
I don't think I like you.
I like the way you smile.
I gave him no choice.
I'm a football player.
I have a lot of questions to answer.
Did Tom do what you asked him to do?
Where's my car?
Is there a problem with my account?
I have what I need.
I don't deserve your love.
Tell Tom what you know.
I have friends here.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
Tom is no exception.
What do you want then?
Where were they born?
I have nothing else to add to that.
She didn't like him.
I couldn't move my right foot.
Raise your hand before you answer.
Humor me.
We don't know what the truth is.
Do you believe what he said?
Would you like to eat something?
What is the doctor doing?
Tom heard you.
Are you biased?
Go with Tom.
How many bags do you have?
Your hair is too long.
I agree with you completely.
Your o's look like a's.
It's clear that you're wrong.
I realized later that the person I was talking to wasn't Tom.
I'm just looking, thank you.
I think that he will succeed.
Aren't you ready to go?
You only have to follow him.
Lend him as much money as he needs.
How many races have you won?
Mary has a car, doesn't she?
I'll come to your house.
My father is a bit old-fashioned.
Tom trusted Mary completely.
There is nothing more refreshing than a cold beer on a hot day.
Progress is inevitable.
Tom didn't want to stay with me.
Ken's dog is very big.
You don't know the truth.
I told Tom I'd be home this evening.
You know this.
I stand corrected.
You don't stand a chance.
What are you holding in your hand?
Let me put something on.
Tom got killed in a traffic accident.
Let's have lunch.
Tom hopes Mary will study French.
They decided to shut down the factory.
This is more than enough for me.
You can talk to Tom.
You're a very handsome man, Tom.
What do you think changed?
These pears are great.
Lions don't meow.
We prayed for their happiness.
Who is the photographer?
Though it was raining, she went out.
Shut up, you're distracting me.
Tom has decided to sell his car.
We'll discuss the problem with Tom.
When does your next class start?
She told her children to put away their toys.
Did you hear it?
Tom will return within three hours.
Please shut the door.
He is always speaking ill of his wife.
I don't want to go to school.
I'm a lousy cook.
I had to walk because there were no taxis.
His argument was most convincing.
Who's this message for?
I'm mad at you.
His ideas are always practical.
I've missed you.
How do you propose to help?
I got out of the car.
I'm not an expert either.
Send me photos.
Why wouldn't Tom want to do that?
Tom knew he'd have to do that.
Tom had a choice.
I heard you scream.
We'll be working together.
I hope I am not disturbing you.
How is your family?
Your suitcase is too heavy.
Are you tired?
She said that she couldn't come to the meeting.
Tom is a survivalist.
I feel like eating something sweet.
It's blank.
Tom will never leave you alone.
I don't live alone.
I accompanied her on a walk.
I'm so worn out.
Do you trust Tom?
He is fond of playing tennis.
Did Tom hurt Mary?
I don't love you anymore.
I'm dizzy.
Before we get started, are there any questions?
I didn't tell her.
You arrived too early.
I didn't expect you.
Tom looks good for his age.
Sami was ill with cancer.
Tom has a right to know.
It's fair.
What's your favorite TV series?
They killed three more hostages.
I can't eat.
I'm not going to go.
You don't have a chance.
Did you hear what I said to Tom?
I've lost my keys.
Move quietly.
I sing at church.
I sat beside her.
You were brave.
Tom was praying.
He is going to stay at a friend's house.
Why is the sky blue?
Tom didn't need to stay with me.
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
Don't you want proof?
Why are you always so skeptical?
Are you going home?
The city is found west of London.
I have to be here.
Tom is in there.
Is Tom planning to go back to Australia?
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Tom forgot to bring a torch.
Nobody wants to dance with me.
He is thirsty for fame.
I think it'll pay off.
This is for you, Tom.
Tom is so gullible.
Were you sober at that time?
Why did you want Tom to do that?
Tom can probably help us escape.
Are you going to fix it?
Tom wanted his family to meet Mary.
Tom should go with Mary.
Could you hand me that hammer?
What've you found?
It will cost around 10,000 yen.
I've gotten used to winning.
I worked hard all day yesterday.
I can't call her.
What is your advice?
I know that most people here hate me.
Do you like to dance?
They will return.
When will she return home?
Could you check the tire pressure?
Did you get what you want from Tom?
The project is still ongoing.
She's five years younger than I am.
It's no use arguing with Tom.
Tom told Mary this would happen.
Everything went smoothly.
You will never understand how I feel.
I am familiar with your name.
Now we're in trouble.
We are cousins.
He's writing a long letter.
Tom went to the beach with Mary last weekend.
He drank milk.
They are neighbors.
You are wasting time.
This is a picture of my mother.
The earth is not only a few thousand years old.
You may kiss me if you like.
He is lacking in experience.
I have to take medicine.
Turn that radio down at once.
Layla was a charming woman.
How come you ate the cucumber, you dimwit? You knew that I wanted to make a cucumber mask!
Tatoeba is the slowest site.
You've never done that before, have you?
Welcome back.
Tom is going to wait in the car.
Nobody asked you.
There's no more salt.
I'm not saying anything.
Forget him.
Why are you crying?
What language do they speak in Australia?
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
There's a book here.
It was an experiment.
Where's the airport?
Did you find your letters?
Can you come tomorrow?
Mary is really pretty.
John and Mary have known each other since 1976.
What he is saying doesn't make sense.
Maybe I'll come back later.
I run five miles a day.
He acted like a lunatic.
I apologize for the delay.
John took a walk along the river.
I've spent a lot of time in casinos.
Don't phone her now.
You've got my helmet.
It is a lot of fun to drive a car.
Every man cannot be happy.
I would like it if we could spend more time together.
You have only to read a few pages of this book.
You want this?
Why did you buy only one banana?
Hold tight.
We play football every Saturday.
I'm ready to go home.
Tom decided.
The meeting was canceled.
I don't know Greek.
Hang on.
Lviv for lions!
I'm so mad.
I've paid you already.
Can you write a letter in English?
The party's on Sunday.
She takes after her father.
What are your plans?
I almost smiled.
We couldn't wait for Tom.
I heard that Tom and Mary have both been arrested.
This is the house where I lived when I was a child.
I didn't tell Tom why I wanted to do that.
No... I mean, yes.
That's personal.
Tom isn't the one who wanted me to do that.
What's your favorite pun?
It tastes really good.
Aren't you scared of Tom?
We are to meet at seven.
Tom clearly doesn't understand what we're talking about.
The accident occurred yesterday morning.
Where are you hiding?
I'm interested.
Give me the book.
It smells bad.
All day long.
I'm seldom late for appointments.
He was embarrassed.
I was so hungry that I ate it.
I don't, either.
Tom's personality complicates matters.
That's the spirit!
Where can I buy a toothbrush?
I may be wrong.
I called Tom.
You're new, aren't you?
It rained five successive days.
It's Christmas.
There are a lot of things I want to ask you.
Please don't blame Tom.
They saw Tom.
Mum says that I speak too quietly.
What on earth is happening?
Did you find your keys?
I agreed to stay.
I came as soon as I got your message.
When will Tom do that next?
What is there in these boxes that are so heavy?
I want to see the manager right now.
Try the cake.
Go inside.
They're brothers.
Tom is dirty.
Why is my computer slow?
I have got beautiful eyes.
You haven't changed at all.
Does Tom know what the problem is?
Keep quiet.
Tom changed color.
Don't leave the door open.
You swim well, don't you?
We would like to buy a sofa.
Is that a fire truck?
Tom said he thinks that Mary isn't able to do that.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
Would you like to know how I did that?
I don't think Tom knows anybody at our school.
What are you eating?
It seems that the burglar broke in through an upstairs window.
Tom teaches French at a high school.
I won't run.
It's never too late.
I hate studying.
He tried putting on his new shoes.
My uncle lives in the east of Spain.
Tom has a very powerful voice.
Aren't you busy tomorrow morning?
It's already 7:00.
I took my camera along.
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
I wish Tom would hurry.
I don't know what I should do yet.
No one comes to visit me anymore.
Where are you heading?
I looked at the map.
She isn't sad.
I saw your father.
Tom called me an idiot.
Where are your children?
They will agree on that.
She does not need to work.
We've been together a long time.
I've been looking for my keys all day.
My father is rich.
Is that necessary?
Tom cheats.
Our team is likely to win.
I read comic books.
Are you married?
Do you like fish?
She likes to read books.
Are you brave?
I've already published three books.
Aren't you guys ready?
Let's straighten out the desk.
I'm waiting.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
What colour is orange?
Tom washed the car this morning.
What did the doctor tell you?
It's only Tom.
I've been looking for my keys all day.
Have a beer.
This is my mother.
Tom beat Mary to death.
She decided to enter the room.
It was probably my fault.
Tom is ugly.
I stirred the soup.
The pupils stand up when their teacher enters.
Tom's feeling a bit off colour.
He is an old friend of mine.
Tom is a perfectionist.
Tom will kill Mary.
The business is slow.
Tom kicked the bucket.
What are you going to do tonight?
Why didn't you call somebody?
He comes to see me nearly every day.
Tom said I looked surprised.
Are you sure that guy's name is Tom?
What shall I put on: trousers or a skirt?
My friend is studying Korean.
How about going out to eat tonight?
I'm twice as old as you are.
We didn't recognize each other.
Did you understand everything?
Tom loved his children.
I don't have vodka.
You're the first.
I agree to your proposal.
I go to school because I want to learn.
Can you pass me that thingamajig?
Young people tend to think so.
What do you like to do?
Am I so different from Tom?
The word "nigger" is an offensive term.
You cannot be a blood donor.
Fantastic!
I have no car.
Tom and I never do that.
We are who we are.
This does not concern you at all.
You can come.
Where's the information desk?
The judge sentenced him to one year's imprisonment.
Tom didn't need to go to Boston.
My name isn't Tom.
She loves her wife.
There is a right time for everything.
I was invited to dinner.
I cannot bear the pain any more.
Everything is fine.
I go to school by bus.
I saw them.
As usual, he reads the newspaper while eating.
I have one.
I haven't lost the game just yet.
Can I eat my lunch here?
This is made in Kazakhstan.
You must take things as they are.
I'm ashamed to have done it.
Come home before six.
What are those for?
You know why I left.
Do you really think I'd do that?
Tom said that he doesn't plan to stay here all day.
Don't catch a cold.
He asked his friends for help.
You're winning.
Tom and Mary want to go home.
It's nothing but flattery.
The goldfinch is a very interesting bird.
I am reading a magazine.
Moscow is in Russia.
Tom said he thinks Mary isn't able to do that.
Tom's parents are missing.
Mama cried.
I often get up very early.
Tom only wants some peace and quiet.
One thing I've always wanted to do is run my own restaurant.
The telephone is a convenience.
I couldn't have done it without Tom.
I got lucky.
Are you sure Tom is going to do that?
Get in the car.
I gave you what you asked for.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
Calm down.
Even Tom didn't have to do that.
You can't ignore Tom.
Don't you want to know how Tom did it?
Tom isn't dating Mary.
That wasn't easy to translate.
It's not a problem, Tom.
The boy talks as if he were a man.
I've forgotten my password.
I don't know her, nor do I want to.
I'll do whatever I can to prevent that from happening.
Both Tom and Mary died.
Tom and I were told to behave ourselves.
You're next.
I think we're having a good time.
They will help.
We detest them.
Why did the accused confess?
Tom does the dishes every night.
What's the secret?
You've got an hour.
Call me.
It's very difficult to understand you.
I am thinking of going abroad.
Tom goes to work by bicycle.
You may go.
He blamed me for the mistake.
Do you speak French?
I don't deny that.
My father is fifty years old.
Do you agree?
Tom is going to jump.
I wondered whether Tom wanted to do that or not.
Please exchange yen for dollars.
Tom saw Mary leave.
Tom isn't like other criminals.
I have to go find Tom.
The pain has mostly gone away.
I thought somebody died.
I like to dance.
Aren't you rich?
Tom counts on Mary.
I want to eat something good.
Tom is groaning.
The world will be watching.
We have to start at once.
Could you bring me some water?
Did Tom do this?
Tom just died.
I almost forgot to do that.
Why aren't you eating your sandwich?
You should've done that.
I thought it might be complicated.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
He will write soon.
Where did you get this car?
Sami will come tomorrow.
Nobody trusts Tom anymore.
I think Tom is very smart.
You're the owner.
When does it arrive?
Mary says she walks to school every day.
You have a right to be happy.
Tom has to be more careful.
Without your help, I would have failed.
When's Tom going to eat?
Tom is more handsome than I expected.
Each student has a locker.
Give them to me.
I was disappointed at the result.
Do you like tomatoes?
You're the best.
I saw Tom trip and fall.
Everyone looks tired.
I fell off the chair.
He's likely to come.
Why don't you have any children yet?
When are you free?
I used to live there.
Do you know where Tom's keys are?
I'm glad it wasn't me.
If you hurry you can still make the train.
Do it in this manner.
Nobody speaks to me.
I looked, but I didn't see anything.
Don't you do that, Tom.
Tom got lost in the forest.
Are you brave?
This is correct.
Don't you know?
I hope Tom likes the present I bought for him.
Tom brought Mary here.
They like to remember old times.
You still think I'm bluffing?
Have you any further questions?
I carried on my work.
Tom and Mary talked about all kinds of things.
Tom is exhausted.
Nobody laughs at his jokes.
This book seems easy to me.
I didn't see him.
Do you think Tom is worried?
Cross your fingers.
Are you interested in joining our team?
I don't read very fast.
I thought you grew up in Australia.
Who stopped?
I made my decision based on what you said.
Close the door when you leave.
Did you know I'm French?
Tom was wearing sneakers.
That boy talks as if he were a grown up.
I think Tom will ask Mary to do that for John.
I believe you'll get over it soon.
Could I drop by your place one of these days?
What do you see in the picture?
Tom is a very intelligent young man.
I even work on Sundays.
He doesn't drink anymore.
I'm never going to leave you.
I think I need a little air.
He is a merry fellow.
The petals of this rose are very tender.
That's what I wrote.
Did you get a chance to talk with Tom?
I'm ready to forgive them.
Tom tried out the massage chair at the store.
Mary was a very quiet, retiring person.
What do you think she is doing now?
That's my mother.
It's Tom's turn to take out the garbage.
Tom drank all evening.
I haven't lost my mind.
Dance.
We're not going to force Tom to do that.
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose?
We don't need any more horses.
Please don't worry.
Don't you want to talk about it now?
Why does Tom want me to do that?
Are you nuts?
Do you think Tom is insane?
Whose handwriting is this?
I bought this racket at a 20 percent discount.
I'm being careful.
It's dangerous for a beginner to swim here.
I'm not a killer.
Believe in science!
It's dark outside.
Tom grew up with Mary and John.
Tom told me I should study French.
Tom won't likely do that tomorrow.
She ate one apple.
At last a good idea struck me.
He likes not only baseball but football.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Mr. Tanaka can play the piano well.
I thought Tom already knew that.
He was my math teacher.
Why do you still allow Tom to do that?
Tom taught me how to be a man.
I expect him to come.
No offence!
It snowed a lot.
Let's take a rest.
There are many latent gays among rampant homophobes.
I have to go upstairs.
She gave me a piece of good advice.
I'm surprised that I don't have to do the same thing you have to do.
Am I supposed to eat this?
I'm riding with Tom.
There were islands in the sea.
I have a girlfriend.
Tom missed his train.
What's your name, son?
Aren't you going to do it?
I think I read that somewhere.
Tell me everything.
You didn't need to come.
I missed the train. I should have come earlier.
Life without love is just totally pointless.
I phoned him.
I'm so nervous.
Do you feel like going swimming?
It sounds to me as if he has something to do with the matter.
No one knew a thing.
I've never been to a French-speaking country.
No, Tom, don't do that.
It's yours.
Tom likes stories.
You asked us to trust you.
Tom didn't do everything he had to do.
Can you say that again?
Things are complicated.
I've always liked him.
This news was a surprise.
Here comes the bus.
You are too kind to me.
You're just scared.
Tom likes Boston.
Tom has no one to help him.
Aren't you studying French?
We'll call you.
Tom may come back.
That was interesting.
Tom isn't a criminal.
Today is cold, isn't it?
They ate at a restaurant.
Why did you decide to buy this house?
I am a bit drunk.
The child is dirty.
Did you know that Tom would be absent?
I wonder whether Tom has told Mary to do that.
I know you're here.
Is this Tom Jackson's house?
Adherents of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster are known as Pastafari.
No.
She hates secrets.
We're not safe yet.
Tom dressed like a girl.
We drank a lot of alcohol.
I prefer unrefined sugar rather than consuming sweeteners.
There's nothing to complain about.
He didn't say anything.
The flower is beautiful.
She thinks highly of him.
You are drunk!
Sometimes I make mistakes.
My joints ache.
She told him to study.
I don't play basketball on Mondays.
May I open a can?
Tom doesn't want Mary to go to Boston.
This island is a paradise for children.
I know you won't do it.
I now know the answers.
She accompanied him to Japan.
What does all of this mean?
Organic food tastes better.
Southward.
Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
What are you making all the fuss about?
Can Tom come back?
Tom's dog hated me.
I've already done everything you've told me to do.
Count to ten.
I'm a football player.
Tom probably isn't in Boston now.
Was I wrong?
Mary asked if she might go home early.
Tom is already waiting.
I found a kindred spirit in Bob.
I'm almost as tall as you.
Do you have a fever?
Tom knew Mary told John not to do that.
Don't lie to me!
This is how he earned so much money.
I'm not hungry.
I doubt that Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Can you count in Italian?
He promised to come, but he didn't come.
I don't think anybody can do that.
My grades are above average.
We are going to have a baby.
Tom wouldn't allow Mary to leave.
I want to rent out my house.
Where's the hammer?
At first, I thought she was joking.
What kind of wine do you recommend?
This is my property.
Why do you need it?
He is rich, but his older brother is poor.
I have never seen my children.
I can't kiss you now.
I have to write a letter.
They betrayed you.
Sami wanted it to be a surprise.
Stop gambling.
Do you want to get married?
Journalism is dead.
You're talented.
Did you think about it?
When did Tom arrive in Australia?
Grab this.
I met nobody on my way home.
Tom has his own business.
Aren't you planning on voting?
It's a pity that Tom can't come.
Is there an ATM nearby?
I am not a fan of liberalism.
Why do you work here?
This isn't fair.
Your room is ready.
Close all of the doors and windows!
I didn't think that Tom would be so busy.
You are such a liar.
Tell us about them.
"Do you know Tom?" "I know of him."
What if I get caught?
I was in London last month.
There is a lot of money.
It's warm.
It doesn't hurt at all.
I never saw a red fridge.
He has no house in which to live.
May I hold your hand?
Tom wanted to be a hero.
I need a helmet.
What happened was horrible.
We had absolutely no control.
Tom thought I'd already done that.
He won many competitions.
Tom and Mary both smiled.
Now don't pout.
Tom is angry with Mary.
Can you prove I'm wrong?
Tom is afraid of Matt.
Are you happy with that?
I could possibly help.
Perhaps I'll see Tom tonight.
Do you want coffee?
This is rubbish.
Are you still homeless?
I wouldn't like to live there.
Tom's parents congratulated him on his engagement.
You've got nothing.
All will be fine.
What's the meaning of MILF?
Have you ever written a letter to Santa?
I don't drink a lot of beer.
I believe that'll happen.
How much fuel have we got?
How did you know where to find Tom?
Who invented this machine?
This book was printed in England.
I think Tom and Mary are lost.
Did you put sugar in my coffee?
Now beat it.
The air is damp.
That's an awful brand.
Tom was very frightened.
Tom owns a car.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
Tom remembered.
Tom stole your car.
My television is broken.
Come on in!
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
I'll do whatever it takes to keep my job.
I want to help her.
Where is the train station?
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Austria played against Australia.
You can't drink seawater because it is too salty.
Yes, this exam is quite tough.
I'd like some more butter.
That is his house.
I want to become a mechanic.
Tom was content.
A man of sense wouldn't speak to you like that.
It looks as if autumn is really here.
This is the first time that I've done this.
Have you already talked to him?
You're observant.
Tom isn't sure how much he drank.
Someone has to pay the price.
Why doesn't anybody help Tom?
Tom will teach you how to do that.
Stay back.
I was laughing.
Food is too expensive.
I took a shower.
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
This string is strong.
What do you think you're doing?
There's nothing in the refrigerator.
It isn't difficult.
There's no reason to panic.
That will not change.
Tom has woken Mary up.
I totally agree.
Wait!
Is this an integer?
Is it white?
I agree with you guys.

The sound of crickets chirping and frogs croaking lulls me to sleep.
Do you want us to go with you?
Tom called Mary up.
Call me!
You're my type.
Tom changed the baby's diaper.
Tom will have no problem getting the report finished on time.
You're in grave danger.
You don't need to wait.
I haven't talked to Tom.
The foreigner soon got used to Japanese food.
Tom asked Mary if she knew John's new telephone number.
I don't think Tom is schizophrenic.
How old are your kids?
You are going to play football tomorrow.
I watched it on YouTube.
We are having a good time.
Tom is very cranky.
I know that you don't like me.
We need more flour.
Every boy here has a girlfriend.
I'm not very handsome.
I feel much better today.
Why did she take a cab?
He can swim fast.
I know that that isn't the reason you're here.
Tom will never agree to it.
When do you plan to return to Boston?
Your girlfriend is older than mine.
I was probably right.
I may be back soon.
My daughter loves to swing.
I think Tom has forgotten how to do that.
My father has five brothers and sisters.
They all knew her.
I'm not angry!
Anyone wants to pick me up from the airport?
I need a new pair of shoes.
He doesn't know anything about electronics.
She's Tom's younger sister.
Everything is going to be OK.
Tom often yells at his children.
You are welcome to do anything you like.
Was it possible?
Why did you tell Tom to do that?
Do you think I'm healthy?
They don't need to know.
Candles were everywhere.
He is Swiss.
Please make yourself at home.
Maybe you should leave.
The poor dog was literally torn apart by the lion.
Have you counted the towels?
It's time to get up.
An electric current can generate magnetism.
I was allowed to do that.
That's odd.
All the answers to this question were wrong.
You're obviously tired.
It is still colder today.
The road is long.
I'll introduce you.
It doesn't work.
Did you say your name was Tom?
Tom says he's doing that.
That's no fun.
This is what I want to do.
I'm able to swim.
You didn't finish your drink.
Did you see Tom while you were in Boston?
This is Chinese food.
I need someone to help me do this.
Don't you want to know?
Not only your father but also I am against your plan.
Happy birthday!
Why are you up so late?
It seems that no one knew the truth.
I felt something was wrong.
Sami went on vacation.
I admired Tom.
Did you take out the garbage?
Did Tom tell you that he'd be late?
Which of you will come with me?
I was scared out of my mind.
Who did you come to see?
I think Tom ought to buy some new clothes.
I like bread.
They're there.
Tom has been given a tough assignment.
We have to take advantage of this situation.
I love life.
I ignored them.
The way is long.
Who goes there?
You'll be happy again.
I wanted to watch that movie with you.
Thanks for this.
My bicycle has been stolen, too.
I can teach you how to repair a computer.
Tell all your friends about the party we're having.
You do not know me or my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.
I'm sorry I asked.
You frightened Tom.
Yesterday was Thursday.
Tom said he doesn't care if he wins or not.
I'm no different from any other mother.
Darwin wrote "the Origin of Species."
I'll be thirty next October.
Let's talk about Boston.
I need to do something.
I saw the red light.
She can't stop her.
Read on.
Why are you helping me?
Swimming is easy.
We're teachers.
Mary, this is Joe's brother David.
You'll be back, I'm sure.
It's the only possible conclusion.
I must leave here today.
Who knows why Tom did that?
Tom quit.
It's too expensive!
Did you find any problems?
How complex is it?
Why did you buy a flower?
I must have been pretty tired.
I like to observe people.
A bead of sweat trickled down Tom's face.
I'm sloshed.
I am a tennis player.
I am compelled to do it.
I should've let Tom leave.
I have finished.
You've frightened me.
We think so.
You seem upset.
She sat next to me.
May your soul rest in peace.
Where does it hurt?
Tom and Mary know that John is smart.
Is Tom cute?
I like to play soccer.
Tom drank a cup of coffee.
It is you who are to blame.
There are many people and cars on that street.
I don't know the way home.
I really need a job.
I had intended to go there.
There is already a subway in Rio.
I wonder whether or not Tom will ever come home.
I didn't know who to give it to.
Tom hid under the bed.
You never responded.
Tom is trying to save his own skin.
I'm very hot.
Tom is smarter.
I think that there still is a chance that that'll happen.
He's found a new love.
I think Tom and Mary are doing that now.
Hold on a minute, please.
You won't believe what I heard.
This is an oxymoron.
I wonder whether or not Tom wanted to sing.
I don't care what will become of me.
Everybody calls him Mac.
I'm leaving now.
You're incredible.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
Tom doesn't know.
Are these bananas ripe?
I'm working late tonight.
Tom doesn't want to lose his job.
He understands physics.
Tom can play the banjo.
I discussed the plan with Tom.
Mary is a sophisticated lady.
Why don't we take a taxi?
I thought that Tom was already back.
I was living in Boston a few years ago.
Add sentences!
I'll tell them to stay outside.
I don't have time now.
When did you get married?
Those Hungarian girls are very pretty.
What makes you think Tom is Mary's boyfriend?
Get in the front seat.
Her questions indicate that she understands the subject very well.
I think we're next.
Tom ate all the popcorn.
It's his.
I know I was wrong.
I feel like having a drink.
It seems to me that he is from England.
My mother plays the piano well.
What do you want Tom for?
I stopped.
Tom became upset.
Tom has much more free time than Mary.
Patronise your own.
What is it you want to do?
Tom wants this.
Don't touch the flowers.
I can't find a place to park.
Why would we want to do that?
Take a break.
I've been very busy all week.
Ask Tom if we can do that.
Doing that was difficult.
Tom said that he planned on going.
I visited my father's grave.
Do you know why Tom doesn't drink?
Tom is my brother's friend.
She is unconscious.
If it doesn't rain soon, our garden is going to dry up.
I didn't testify.
Our school starts at eight thirty.
The meeting will be held regardless of the weather.
Tom had a lot more money than Mary.
Where's your daughter?
I'm free now.
Sooner or later, we'll have to tackle the problem in earnest.
He gave her a book.
There was no one there.
Tom asked me why I had done that.
I am sure that he will win.
They refused to help her in any way.
I am sorry that she is absent from the conference.
Let's try another approach to the matter.
Europeans like to drink wine.
This table is reserved.
I thought it was true.
How is your family?
Where're the shoes?
Tom doesn't know what he'll do.
The school was established in 1650.
I have many discs.
The internet is a waste of time.
The magazine is for killing time.
After you, Tom.
I fell off the stage.
Tom's parents were Canadian.
They're fast.
Tom was crying the entire time.
Do you think Tom is too young?
I don't have a sister.
They were friends.
I really gotta piss.
Aren't you all ready?
I'm not scared of him.
I like studying French.
Get off my planet, you Martian scum!
I can keep a secret.
Tom grabbed Mary by the arm.
Mary has lost her key.
Tom is stuck.
Do you think I still love her?
Where did you find this wallet?
Why Tom did that is beyond my comprehension.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
I'm very happy.
Tom seems much happier than Mary.
Someone is calling you.
I have two cars.
Please call the fire department.
The floor is cold.
I think I'm resolute.
I worked in Rio de Janeiro for two years.
Tom has a desire to be wealthy.
Who told you Tom did that?
What're Tom and Mary planning?
Is this your all's cellphone?
Tom cut a hole in the fence and crawled through.
I saved a seat for Tom.
What did you do last night?
I'm going.
What's Tom doing?
Tom advised me to do that.
Everyone came to the party, except Tom.
I have many photos.
A small car is more economical than a large one.
What a fine moon we have tonight!
Her mother has made her what she is.
I collect comics.
I'm guessing you didn't buy this yourself.
Does that make any sense?
How much candy did you eat?
You are allowed to go.
Tom couldn't help overhearing what Mary said to John.
Mary is working in her office.
Tom works out regularly.
I wrote down the address for you.
Tom probably died.
We don't want Tom to go.
It was very cold this morning.
Tom said that he'll be doing that on his own.
I can give it a try.
Aren't you surprised?
There were many things Tom didn't like.
I got a letter from a friend.
My cat barks.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know how to play chess.
Only one thing worries me.
Will you light the fire?
I am going to work during the spring vacation.
I have a cat and a dog.
I look forward to meeting Tom.
Are you sure you've never met him?
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend.
Did you meet her?
Listen to what I have to say.
It needs to be fixed.
Are you the group leader?
It's a phone call from a Mr Brown.
The aardvark is a medium-sized animal.
You must be very busy.
I like Mary.
She hugged him.
Where is his teddy bear?
Give Tom a hand.
How many girlfriends have you had?
I know nothing about him.
I can't believe we finally made it.
He has one son and two daughters.
He's left-handed.
I'm honest.
I love you, Tom.
What'll that cost?
Tom said he saw Mary at the movie theater with John.
Could you shut up?
He's always joking.
That's absolutely right.
Did this just happen?
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry I canceled our date last night.
The password is "Muiriel."
I thanked him for what he had done.
Do you think I am nuts?
Have you seen all these movies?
It is no use arguing with him.
Tom got famous overnight.
Hey, where's Tom?
Tom will do that some other time.
We can't understand French.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
This is the best dictionary that I have.
You do not need to like everything.
I have a lot of respect for you.
Tom is rather slow.
Do you think Tom is still planning to do that?
Tom might get injured if he does that.
You should tell Tom that you won't do that.
Only God knows.
She's assertive.
I am in Berlin.
I wonder whether or not Tom has already told Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom shrugged.
You don't have to do that if you don't want to.
You can take off the bandage tomorrow.
I don't understand English.
Tom went instead of Mary.
He just arrived.
I used to have a job in Boston.
Who speaks Russian?
Didn't you know Tom lived with us?
Tom followed after Mary.
Tom reformatted his hard drive.
We are breathing pure air.
Do you know that man standing over there?
I got dizzy.
She has been in the hospital for a month.
What makes you think Tom has never been to Boston?
Do you like snow?
I'll lend you this book.
You did nothing.
I helped Tom open the box.
Everyone is talking about Tom.
Tom's eavesdropping.
Yes, that's the right answer.
Where's my food?
Does anybody know him?
When did you go to sleep?
I didn't know that Tom couldn't drive.
That isn't Tom's car.
Tom said Mary is very tired.
No matter what you do, Tom will never agree.
We have a black and white dog.
I'll certainly do this.
It was not my idea.
Faith, unity, discipline.
This is a good song.
It's not a pig; it's a monkey.
Eating fish is good for your health.
I like you as a friend.
Pick a date.
The teacher admonished us that we should be silent.
It was cold, and in addition, it was windy.
It's okay, you can tell me.
I'll return to Australia on October 20th.
What time's your train?
I don't think you should follow Tom's advice.
It's a complex question.
He gave me a good piece of advice.
I had to hide.
Stay away from us.
I heard a gunshot.
Mary says she'll come.
Do you remember?
We want you to marry Tom.
Is your father a doctor?
I thank you with all my heart.
I like my native language.
Aren't you a teacher?
It's his favorite Italian word.
Don't let that bother you.
Come on, trust me.
I don't know how to help.
I'll return at 6:30.
I have one in the car.
He had to carry many loads from the house to station.
You still owe me some money.
Tom can do that by himself now.
Tom made one serious mistake.
I like the cut of his jib.
It was bound to happen and finally it did.
It's a complicated language.
Where exactly are we going?
I'll wait until six o'clock.
You're angry, aren't you?
This is Room 839.
Oh god.
It is up to you.
These books are accessible to all members.
I've thanked Tom for the present.
You may have to do that by yourself.
Tom jumped out of his bed.
Being bald's not so bad.
How did you accomplish this?
They buy vegetables at the supermarket.
When you have things you don't understand written on you, what will you do, if you get unexpected results?
They are speaking Dutch.
That's exactly what I meant.
What you did was a big help.
I could try.
I know you're complaining about your car being totaled but it's just a good thing you weren't injured. You should be thankful to be alive.
My father is out.
Pray for me.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
Are you sure Tom will come?
She has got long hair.
What're they up to?
Tom's wife died in 2013.
No one except Tom came.
What's the weather like in Boston?
Tom is a hermit.
There's no need to wait.
The world has changed.
I thought that Tom wouldn't do that.
She's a man now.
I will never tell!
I hear voices.
What do you know?
I don't smoke.
Tom handed Mary her bag.
Tom drinks too much these days.
Bunnies are social animals.
Tom plays chess.
He came close to losing an eye.
Could you please open the blinds?
I'm starting to feel sleepy.
I don't see the difference.
Tom wanted to know why Mary was absent.
I won't dance.
Tom told Mary he had to go home early.
He must be sick; he looks pale.
How long will it take?
The problem has been resolved.
Let's play cards.
I brought wine.
You wanted me to do that, didn't you?
You may give the book to whoever wants it.
Everything has got its time.
You're a lying pig.
I'm an expert.
I've got much work to do at the moment.
Tom gets along with everyone.
How many kids do Sami and Layla have?
Is it true that you wanted to buy a car from Germany?
It isn't likely Tom will do that.
Do you want some coffee?
Tom should shut up.
Tom was with us the entire time.
Can I offer you some cognac?
This house mouse is grey.
If you want my vote, you'll have to earn it.
I doubt that Tom can win.
I knew your brother.
What did you tell Tom?
Did you tell Tom you were joking?
Even the bad weather failed to ruin my mood.
Why didn't you kiss Tom?
I had intended to finish this yesterday, but I couldn't.
Tom isn't wearing shoes.
All you have to do is push this red button.
I opposed that idea.
Does it offend you?
Tom introduced Mary to John.
Tom didn't want to do that anymore.
I thought I was going to be able to do that.
I need to exchange dollars for pesos.
What did you buy your boyfriend?
Brush your teeth.
Don't you feel cold?
Tom has had a bad morning.
Tom might have eaten before he came.
I could've saved Tom's life.
Tom doesn't have to go there.
Tom is trying not to do that.
Tom took my umbrella by mistake.
Today is Wednesday.
I'm very hungry now.
Are you angry with me?
He's very good at playing guitar.
Are you German?
I have an extra umbrella I could lend you.
I can't carry this suitcase. It's too heavy.
Tom gambled away a fortune in one night.
Please shave my beard.
I came to support Tom.
You don't have to do that now.
Please give me a glass of water.
Who did you give the book to?
Those are sunflowers.
Tom wanted to be an artist.
Sami stayed upstairs.
It's a lovely country.
Don't take it personally.
What's your problem?
I did it myself.
She got married at the age of seventeen.
I did not understand.
I would like to rent a car.
The soldiers were animated by the song.
We had next to nothing in the kitchen.
I knew that Tom was in Australia.
Not choosing is choosing already.
Education in this world disappoints me.
The bus had already left when I got to the bus stop.
Did you ever work with Tom?
There are no problems.
I will work.
I can bring you some water, if you like.
Can't you see what's happening?
Tom asked Mary if she'd like a cup of coffee.
Tom stayed home.
They liked large cars.
Tom isn't a friend of Mary's.
Red is a colour.
Aren't we friends?
Did you give Tom my phone number?
Tom is an embarrassment.
Why does he always arrive late?
Much ado about nothing.
I've never heard Tom speak French.
We shouted in order to warn everyone of the danger.
Children imitate their parents.
The man is tall.
What are your plans for tonight?
Please let me go home.
Are you saying that my life is in danger?
She's Dutch.
Tom doesn't know the difference between Easter and Christmas.
The dog knows black from white.
I wish I'd done this earlier.
This is the best dictionary we sell.
What is a god?
Say something!
Tom won't be allowed to do that again.
I'm trying to save money.
She loves coffee.
You'd be amazed how many times I've told Tom not to do that.
They named their son John.
Everyone prayed.
Don't touch that blue button.
How can a skinny person like you eat so much?
I loved Mary.
I've been released.
Let's have dinner.
Tom doesn't like fish very much.
Tom has learned how to sing a few songs in French.
Do you think it's a sign?
Ukraine became independent again when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
The house whose roof is green is mine.
I'm already working on it.
Tom wasn't a bit surprised by how well Mary could speak French.
Tom refused to even consider my plan.
Here's the key.
There was a lot of food in the house.
We hoped to have done with the work before the holidays.
Please show me some pictures.
I'm going outside to play. Are you coming with?
Yes, this is Anthony.
Revenge can be sweet.
You're my problem.
I did what I could.
I've had enough to eat already.
That doesn't interest me anymore.
Attack me.
I only have American coins.
Tom deliberately did that.
I'm sure Tom didn't have to be alone.
He seemed to have been ill.
Tom let the cat in.
The girl always carries her doll about.
Why did you return home today?
Tony speaks English well.
The students found the final examination to be a breeze.
Is Tom willing to do that?
What colour were they?
I did it for you.
I have a computer.
You don't look very excited.
Tom isn't mistaken.
He said he would go to America.
He asked about you.
Why does everyone think I'm stupid?
Judy likes him.
Please don't leave valuable things here.
The movie is X-rated.
I did everything you told me to do.
Tom had never seen such a beautiful garden before.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
I'm quite unlucky.
Evolution is a lie.
My name is Wang.
You found the answer.
I'm trying to be happy.
She got me by the hand.
Tom promised me he wouldn't be late.
Tom wasn't the only person that Mary talked to.
Tom didn't have the money.
Where did you get this key?
This isn't what we planned.
I didn't know that was possible.
Tom hadn't been prepared for that.
Tom is aware of it now.
Have you seen his new film?
Do you see that girl over there?
He was speaking.
I still live by myself.
How did you know we were here?
I heard Tom.
I am Antonio.
I don't like the house he is living in.
I made it.
In addition to this, there are other reasons.
May I interrupt you?
That's too expensive!
Failure to water plants will cause them to die.
Tom was hit.
I know that Tom is going to hate this.
Tom took his trousers off.
Please don't say anything to Tom about my being here.
The country is in a bad economic state.
Let's meet again soon.
I'm a stranger here.
They drank two bottles of wine.
There is nothing here but clothing.
It's a well-known fact.
It's a Russian name.
I study English an hour every day.
Tom said he was going to stay up all night.
Tom couldn't do what he needed to do.
Don't let the dog in.
Does Tom have a big nose?
Wash the car.
What's your opinion?
There aren't any chairs in this room.
Did you think I'd really drink that?
You're pretty stubborn.
Tom was a friend of mine.
He won the first prize at the chess tournament.
Tom is wearing a black coat today.
Why doesn't Tom want Mary to do that?
Tom is a very clever student.
Please don't go away.
Mary sleeps in a comfortable bed.
They forced me to take the medicine.
Please step inside.
Do you have money?
Wait here till I come back.
Is that important?
I don't object to your going out to work, but who will look after the children?
I made Tom promise me that he wouldn't tell anybody what happened.
Draw with a pencil.
Everything will be perfect.
What did Tom just say?
You have to leave.
Do you know where I can find Tom?
She woke him up.
I like ketchup.
I know that you won't be able to do that by yourself.
All the students went home.
I apologized to my boss.
Tom was fast asleep.
You did that on purpose, didn't you?
Tom felt sorry for Mary.
I tried to be evasive.
My vision is not what it used to be.
Tom ate half a bag of potato crisps.
Tom says he has a lot of old stamps.
I heard Tom hates Mary.
We would like to stay here tonight.
Do not open the present yet.
I know your father.
Like mother, like daughter.
I couldn't sleep well last night.
Do you plan to do that sometime?
Tom seems very scared.
Should I call you a taxi?
When will you leave?
Can we afford it?
Build it.
Do you think Tom and Mary know what's going on?
When do you plan on beginning?
It's 2:30 now.
I'm learning Icelandic.
Mary was the only girl Tom was interested in.
This mouse was killed by my cat.
Tom got married.
I smoke.
What languages are you able to speak?
They're in the science lab.
Quote me an example.
No one can make me happy.
Thank you, sir.
Do Tom and Mary know about each other?
When will you leave?
I won't read it.
Do you have anything for a stomach ache?
I think this dictionary will be of great help to me.
What time does the train depart?
It's an inside joke.
Tom likes Mary more than he likes Alice.
What's your favorite time of day?
Let's dance.
I'll be thirty soon.
Tom moved to Germany.
I got an A.
I eat bread.
Why is everybody crying?
It was nice to speak with her.
He walks his dog every morning.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
I heard a scream.
I like pizza very much.
I just have to keep working hard.
Tom is a madman.
I hope Tom remembers us.
Tom doesn't know why Mary is scared.
Tom said that he plans to do that Monday.
He fell in love with his best friend.
Mary hid her money.
Who does this belong to?
This flower is beautiful.
You'll get fired.
I never could've done this without your help.
She's watching the Olympics.
I didn't think Tom would ask Mary to the prom.
This is my ship.
I won't allow Tom to do that anymore.
I'm the only one you can trust.
I like running.
Thank you for your letters.
I used to live here.
Someone stole my passport.
We have no sugar.
Why do onions make you cry?
I must speak with them.
It's time for you to go to bed.
If you sign up to Facebook, your information will be sent to intelligence agencies.
This isn't news.
I don't know what Tom's intentions were.
He is our English teacher.
I'm very fat.
It is in the kitchen.
Layla committed suicide.
The leaves fall in autumn.
I'll give him your message when he comes.
What should we cook?
His e-mail address is hirosey@genet.co.jp.
Let me tell you about the case.
This water is delicious.
Don't cry, Tom.
That cloud looks like China.
My opinion doesn't matter.
Tom is disgusting.
Tom said Mary couldn't do that.
Well, let's try it.
Why haven't you asked Tom?
You should know yourself.
Have you ever kissed a boy?
If there is a suitable occasion, I'll introduce you to him.
I couldn't help laughing at the plan.
Are you up?
How much is the house?
He dwells in the country.
It's because you're a girl.
Tom never loved you.
In spring everything looks bright.
How did Tom know that was going to happen?
It's really cold today.
I want milk.
I was fair.
Tom made some cookies for his children.
Tom has nothing.
I was glad to see him.
Tom has just finished writing his report.
I owe a lot of people an apology.
Tom should've stayed at home.
Your gums are in bad shape.
Tom and Mary were here.
I wonder whether or not Tom is a picky eater.
The cat likes to sleep beside me.
Tom is going to figure this out.
Who else was there?
I thought you wanted Tom to marry you.
You're starting to sound like your old man.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
Twenty thousand yen, please.
Tom has a large telescope.
Could you tell us a story?
Do you think Tom and Mary are happy?
Don't you want me to go with you?
Please send me a letter as soon as you arrive.
This camera is cheap.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
I have no faults.
Tom looks a little worried.
I acted as a simultaneous interpreter.
I would die for you.
I don't know what you mean.
Are these gestures used in the USA?
I'm not a Canadian.
It might be snowing in Boston.
Even the blackest cow only gives white milk.
I am not what I was ten years ago.
Tom doesn't often do his homework before dinner.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I didn't win.
I'm sorry, but there's no other way to do this.
Personal computers are very useful.
You are in danger.
I think I'm in trouble.
I'm no expert.
Tom heard Mary's voice.

What did you do after you ate dinner?
The room was full of bugs, millions of small, wriggling bugs with lots of legs.
