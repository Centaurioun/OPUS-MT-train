I'm giving up smoking.
Tom's apartment is on the third floor.
We were driven to the wall.
She invited me to dinner.
I like this dog.
Perhaps you should see a doctor.
Tom and Mary will take care of John.
Tom knew a lot.
You found the answer.
Tom stayed up all night.
Tom won't fail us.
I didn't realize you knew her.
Tom was a good friend of yours, wasn't he?
Tom's grandmother died from salmonella.
He knew too much.

She loves the children.
I now know why Tom did what he did.
Said and left.
Excuse me, what queue is this?
I love you, sweetheart.
Religion is a contentious topic for many people.
She went to this shop and that.
You have a message.
There's no milk left.
I've already told you that.
This bag cost six quid.
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts.
Yes, how much do they cost?
It was raining when I woke up, but by afternoon the sky had cleared up and the sun was shining.

Mandolines are convenient for slicing vegetables.
I'll read a book while you're sleeping.
Let's go outside and look at the stars.
Tom runs very fast.
It's too expensive.
Did you grade the tests?
She looks a lot like her mother.
I work in an office.
Tom had to work three shifts to pay his bills.
Do you know when Tom got here?
His head ached.
Drive carefully.
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit.
I want a massage. I need to relax.
Mrs. Bruce was the first female pilot to fly between England and Japan.
He looked around, but he saw no one.
Madrid is the capital of Spain.
We can clearly see the cycle of the seasons in Canada.
I wear white shirts on weekdays.
Everyone was friendly to the new girl.
We often hear you sing.
Set the clock right.
She saw me enter the store.
This is a great victory.
I want to visit a medieval village.
They were almost starving.
Everything in your stupid country smells like feet and shattered dreams.
Ken is happy.
I want to know what's going on out here.
I haven't seen you in here before.
Scarcely had I gone out, when it started to rain.
Do you have a computer?
Tom scratched himself.
It must be nice to have friends in high places.
Tom said he didn't often go to Boston.
She's a journalist.
You're crafty.
You're the leader.
Tom never really wanted to go to Harvard.
I didn't expect you so soon.
He's Japanese.
Before I forget, I will tell you.
I know I'm in trouble now.
Those glasses suit you.
Where is he?
Lock the window before going to bed.
They confused the names of the sender and the addressee.
We can use force if we have to.
How was your holiday?
This will only take a moment.
How long can you hold your breath?
I was trying to remind something but I couldn't.
I have a dictionary.
You'll go home with a broken nose!
Is Tom conscious?
How many misfortunes these poor children have suffered!
The number of students going abroad to study is increasing each year.
I think you'll be very pleased.
Yesterday's maximum temperature was 37¬∫C.
I don't think Tom knows anyone in Boston.
I love sport.
He gave me a vague answer.
Both you and your brother are wrong.
What is it you want to know?
No, thank you. I'm just looking around.
You have to learn French.
Who is there?
Did Tom have anything interesting to say?
If I was Tom, I would've punched Mary in the face.
He's agreed to do the job.
He has a large house and two cars.
Can I get an advance on my salary?
This is very kind of you.
I'd like to book three seats.
Don't lean against this wall.
Now you are an adult.
You've done good work so far.
They're here for me.
I hope they don't resort to violence to accomplish their goals.
Tom has been asleep for three hours.
He is French.
Do you feel giving gifts is important?
I fully agree!
My bag was stolen.
Tom's favorite color is blue.
Tom leafed through the magazine that was on the coffee table.
It seems reasonable.
May I ask you a favour?
I never thought about it that way.

You have been busy.
For centuries Cracow was the capital of Poland.
Please take care of our dog while we're away.
I brought you another blanket.
Tom has a new boss.
I don't know anybody in Boston.
Excuse me, please. I didn't understand that. Can you maybe translate it into one of the following languages?
Go away from the window.
Many people only speaks one language.
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
At first, I didn't like him.
I would have failed without his help.

Eighteen minutes later, the battle was over.
In the winter, I sleep under two blankets.
From here on out you'll be on your own.
Who hates you?
There is Tokyo.
I bought lots of stuff.
Stand by.
Let's build something.
I'll get you a nice girl.
Do you know his brother?
Let's get together again!
Is your menstruation normal?
It may rain at any moment.
They are bitter enemies.
I would go at 10.
Let's cross the street.
I know we'll be able to do that.
I would never have guessed that Tom and Mary would fall in love with each other.
I have bad news for you.
As soon as I can afford it, I plan to travel around the world.
I've already shown Tom how to do that.
Even pigs can climb a tree when flattered.
They don't allow us to go to disco.
Do you have any aspirin?
I not only gave him some advice, I gave him some money.

I think you still love Tom.
I want to be a poet.
Come nearer so that I can see your face.
You're twice as smart as anyone else in the room.
What do you expect to find here?
We bought a grand piano which took up half of our living room.
Tom's mother is such a gossip.
Where's it from?
I like movies.
Mary resembles her mother in looks, but not in personality.
They believe it.
Be kind.
We don't even know how to contact Tom.
I don't work on Mondays.
Does that mean we're in trouble?
Don't be so naive.
I didn't even know his name.
Do you have a larger size?
In order to be loved, be lovable!
May I ask you what your name is?
Such languages as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Next time you'll pay for it!
I think Tom will be angry.
Tom's going to be a grandfather again.
I'll go with Tom and Mary.
You left your keys in the door.
You're freaky.
Tom ripped the envelope open.
Are you going to sing here?
I'm an attorney.
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
I'd better solve this problem quickly.
I must help him.
She cut the tomatoes into thin slices.
You are accountable to me for his actions.
He was killed by my hand.
He left Africa forever.
