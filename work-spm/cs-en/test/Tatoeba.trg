He studied at a foreign university.
That girl who's wearing a scarf is a virgin.
Why are you so sad?
For certain tasks, my computer can be very useful.
Give water to the thirsty and food to the hungry.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom sneezes quite often. He may have hay fever.
I don't care what they say.
There was occasional laughter.
Have a look.
Sylvia lives in Alsace.
What else do you want me to tell Tom?
You need to go now.
Tom asked for help.
I discovered a very nice place today.
We have been good friends for ten years.
Thanks for checking.
Tom agreed to be here at 2:30, but he's not here yet.
I want a few empty glasses.
I think you still love Tom.
The train has just left.
I did a little research.
Pay no attention to it.
The bus was full.
When did Tom wake up?
Losing the job she loved so much was a severe blow for Mary.
Because I didn't know what to do, I asked him for advice.
She will consider this.
The woman he married is very beautiful.
Together or separately?
It's too smoky here for me.
Are you in?
Tom left a note for Mary.
We need to dust the table.
Don't forget your umbrella.
I have a dog.
Where are your manners?
Tom and Mary bought a handmade rug.
Tom sat there for a moment without saying anything, and then he got up and left the room.
We've ordered Chinese food.
A rook is a chess piece.
Do you remember the day when we first met?
Nobody likes you.
I have a terrible headache!
This is a pen.
It's sad to know that we may die any moment.
As far as I am concerned, I have no objection.
It was almost noon by the time Tom woke up.
See you tomorrow.
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
The man set himself on fire.
Tom seems to have lost his meaning of life.
Yesterday he came back late.
They all drowned.
I don't know why I even bother anymore.
He doesn't like fish.
I have been associated with him for ten years.
Don't send it to me again.
How much did they give you for your old car?
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Tom was bored with his job.
Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life.
Don't you trust us?
Can you imagine how scared Tom was?
As far as I know, there is no such function.
It takes patience to do this.
We've decided to go to Australia in October.
Tom hurt Mary.
They were disappointed that you could not come.
It's never too late to change your life.

Money does not grow on trees.
The sky is clear.

What happened in October?
I'll let you know when we come to the station.
I'm glad to hear that she is unmarried.
The show will begin soon.
Tom kicked the bucket.
Don't be coy.
She worked for the radio station.
If I'd only taken your advice!
Tom should have been outside playing with the other children.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
There is no choice.
I used to eat like a pig.
I like math.
You are both pretty and kind.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Come on, let's get breakfast.
It's possible Tom won't come.
He was master of the situation.
You're something of a troublemaker, aren't you?
I'm lucky that no one saw me do that.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't be at the party.
I would often go swimming in the sea when a child.
That's an old German custom.
If you drink, don't drive. If you drive, don't drink.
Tom was a witness.
You have to take a shower.
Tom said he never saw Mary.
I think he's innocent.
How did you know I'd be here?
You won't believe what I heard.
I prefer coffee.
A shave, please.
Have you got a lighter?
You broke your leg.
I like fish.
They are here.
I like astrology.
I think we should continue this conversation outside.

I won't lie.
I'd hate to see that happen to you.

Tom prefers science books to fiction.
Tom doesn't know what's bothering Mary.
That old lasso is on the left.

Jump.
How to do it?
She was at a loss what to do.
Everything he says is correct.
Do you remember where you left your umbrella?
Give me a piece of chalk.
He gave the child a toy.
We're still together.
Have you learned nothing from your mistakes?
Why is he sitting there for so long?
Are you observant?
I haven't been there since October.
Mind your own business!
Start now.
One out of three persons in this city has his own car.
I like red wine much more than white wine.
Education in this world disappoints me.

He has a nose bleed.
Tom made me leave.
He admitted that he stole the gold.
You shouldn't have come.
We both fell asleep.
You're not bored, are you?
I'll call later.
Your account is empty.
I read your report and found it very interesting.
You're probably thirsty.
Her voluptuous body attracted me.
Do you have a soup tureen?
Are you free this weekend?
Ask Tom.
He formed the clay into a bowl.
The more you eat, the more you want.
He writes books.
We used to do that every Monday.

I'll be back late.
I've been spending a lot of time studying for IT certifications recently.
Gasoline prices affect all of us one way or another.
You should have listened to me.
I wanted to learn from the best.

What time do you start seating?
Tom can't deny this.
I was very scared of snakes.
You speak nonsense, my friend.
Update my software.
Why do you always look so tired?

I've never known a girl so affected. She's really unbearable!
I love you.
Tom was executed.
I thought that you lived in Boston.
They set up a new company in London.

She is too young to marry.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
I'm used to talking to children.
I think you know what I mean.
I like your car.
The garden was overgrown with weeds.
He kicked the bucket.
Please put their name on everything they take with them.
She's going to make it.
What didn't you like about us?
Are you waiting for Tom?
Do you know how dangerous that is?
Sami wanted to testify.
I already know what you're going to say.
What did I win?
Dorothy sent him a nice present.
This seems kind of expensive.
I've always been attracted to older women.
What did I miss?
I need your answer before the day's over.

This is taking way too long.
Are you sure this is safe to eat?
It was quite dark when I got home.
It's like a bad dream.
What time does the train depart?
Ancient people worshipped many gods and goddesses.
Give me a break.
Better be careful, you're playing with fire.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
Do you still like it here?

This book is written in English.
What are you doing in a place like this?
The window opened.

His report has just been handed in.
There's still some beer in the fridge.
Be careful not to burn yourself.
What is your goal?
My cousin is a journalist.
Tom kicked the bucket.
They do not understand.
I don't want to climb on the roof.
You shouldn't have told Tom that.
Several men got angry with Tom in the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to take them on.
It was nothing more than an accident.
Do you have a smartphone?
Tom liked it.
Why is Tom helping us?
You should be ashamed of your stupidity.
I was beginning to worry.
I'm not sure of it either.

Where've you been recently?
Return the money to him at once.

Tom still has to talk to Mary about that.
She always gives an instant answer.
Tom stopped here.
You won't be needing that again.
It was a huge success.

I understand.
Tom doesn't doubt that Mary will arrive on time.
Hail the Soviet Union!
Tom is Mary's hero.

What color are the birds?
What do you mean, Tom?
What does what happened last night have to do with what's happening today?
They deserve it.
Can I do anything for you?
Do you miss your wife?
He has arrived here now.
What he did was against humanity.
You look like a cop.

He looked around the house.
French is a difficult language.
I got up at six this morning.
You obviously don't live here.
When did your friend leave for America?
Stop that!
Perhaps I could handle that.

Even though Tom explained it in detail, I'm still not sure I really understand it.
I like you.
You see everything in black colours.
Mom, I'm hungry.
It seems I'm going to be up all night tonight.
How did that get in here?

That's not a cat. That's a dog.
Tom has borrowed a company car without permission.
I swear it wasn't me.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I was just going to scare Tom.
It's fucking hot.
Can I check in now?
Please wait for me at the station.
I'm ready to work.
You disgust me.
They said yes.
A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes.
I just don't want to be left completely alone.
I do still love you, Mary, even if you are getting old.
How many rooms does their apartment have?
I don't want to study today.
Can you show us the house?
I'm not afraid of you, Tom.
One of my friends knows you.
You used to smoke, didn't you?
You make me sick.
Go to the other side.
Tom won't be helping us tomorrow.
Have you read this yet?
I'm sad.
Life is a riddle and love is the answer.
I hope you're not mad at me.
That sounds fun.
Tom is used to that.
I'm working as quickly as possible.
I feel the same way you do.
Don't be impatient!
Psychology is the science of the mind.
What did you do last night?
I parked on the street in front of your house.
I've been asked to give you a message.
It seems very interesting.
Tom is preparing supper.
This building has been condemned.
It wasn't cold.
Could that change?
We're closed tomorrow.
I'll tell you everything about it.
What did you think of the movie?
That has nothing to do with you.
There are lots of people who don't have any idea about that.
I didn't have the heart to tell Tom about that.
Won't you have another glass of milk?
Tom is used to it.
I am sure of success.
Tom loves horses.
Do you really do that?
What would you do if you were in my place?
Are you new, too?
I'd rather stay here.
Birds usually wake up early in the morning.

Tom was attacked by a wolf.
Where've you been?
Tom is extremely untalented.
I've got a better idea.
The forest is teeming with monkeys.
What's happening to you? Do you trust that person?
I hesitated to leave his grave.
Do you think I'm qualified for that job?
I like spring.
I don't like the book.
We're staying here.
I'm sure Mary is gravely ill.
She bought a toy for the boy.
He tried in vain to quit smoking.
It's so simple.
Tony did not know their names.
There is your bag.
Experience brings wisdom.
Tom pressed a hidden button.
If you do it once more, you will be sacked immediately.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
He went blind.
When do the Christmas holidays begin?
Tom used to give me advice.
Green suits you.
She saw him break the window.
Prepare to be pleasantly surprised.
