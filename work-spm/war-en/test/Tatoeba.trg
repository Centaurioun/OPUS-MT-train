Tom is going to do it.
Take good care of Tom.
I've heard they don't let girls in this club.
I never touch beer.
He remains loyal to his principles.
I don't know how much longer it'll take.
I heard my name called.
This is the more useful of the two.
I prefer walking to driving in a big city like Tokyo.
I told you I didn't see anything.
Japan is weird.
Joan is running in the city.
I can't believe that this is happening. Please tell me that it's a lie!
I wish I'd bought that bicycle.
She began to talk to the dog.
I study English at school.
They don't want her back.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
I already talked to this student.
Are you sure you have enough money?
We've done it twice in three months.
I received a coded message from Tom this morning.
Tom is a compulsive gambler.
Get over here, Tom.
I planned a party for you.
Soon you'll get used to living by yourself.
We have many members.
Don't push the wrong button.
Tom walked into the drugstore.
You won.
Why is Tom here?
You can't hide the fact from her.
It's rat meat.
I can't reach any of the books on the top shelf.
I can't talk to you here. It's too dangerous.
Tom is leaving in the morning.
You won.
I arrived here yesterday.
Tom will go to Boston tomorrow.
What made her so angry?
It's not good to stay up late at night.
Australia isn't Austria.
Man, what the hell are you looking for?
I want to join you.
I'm 24.
What time is it now by your watch?
I know that feeling, too.
Tom climbed the tree.
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
I want to get in touch with her.
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said.
What is your occupation? What do you do here?
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
There's lots of people at the park.
He can't afford to buy a new car.
Tom can't afford to take a vacation now.
Because he's working alone today, it's taking him longer to finish the job.
Let's just try it. Who cares what happens afterward? There's no sense thinking too much about that.
This place is different.
Keep watch on him.
Not knowing what to do, I called her.
Tom is timid, isn't he?
Tom lives in a small village.
He's a nerd.
Put it there.
Are we likely to arrive in time?
I am very glad school is over.
You make me laugh.
I wasn't able to catch the ball that Tom threw to me.
That's what we're hoping.
He went to London in 1970.
They are not interested in other languages.
I love you.
There are plans to build a power plant right here.
You would never do that.
What made her so angry?
I'd die if anything happened to you.
We must stop this.
I really don't have anything else to say.
We don't have to starve.
I'm sorry I have a previous appointment.
I'm going, too.
I think this is perfect.
The market is big.
I'll talk to Tom alone.
Two children are sitting on top of the fence.
I don't know.
Oh no!
He only reads prose.
Tom is just a boy.
Let's hope it still works.
I am tired and I want to go to bed.
I know that Tom didn't do that.
Do you still want us to meet?
Tom seems stressed.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
Let me think for just a second.
He remained silent during the meeting.
Do you know where she is?
Do we need more inflation?
I just wanted to keep things simple.
Mary said she wanted to do that, but she didn't.
I don't think I'll have the time to do that today.
Tom was shot in the chest.
I'll go and get them.
You shouldn't be jealous.
Everybody's in bed.
Tom was there, but he didn't help us.
Tom will go to Boston tomorrow.
When she heard the news, she was not happy.
She switched on a machine.
I didn't go.
Open your book to page ten.
Tom is going to do it.
We have nothing to complain about.
Don't let her run away.
The day turned out to be fine.
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
She wants children, but he doesn't.
We don't know for sure.
Let us help one another.
How often do you see Tanaka?
Try to get here on time tomorrow.
You're going?
I'll be back by six o'clock.
Some students aren't going to come back next semester.
We haven't seen him.
I've known Tom for years.
I managed to get in.
Swedish is easy.
I never meant to deceive you.
You are taller than she is.
Tom quickly learned how to swim.
I don't really remember.
Tom says he sees things that I can't see.
Wait until I'm done eating.
Who told you that I was sick?
Tom spends most of his spare time practising the guitar.
He tends to get angry when he doesn't have his own way.
What do you think they're planning?
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Get the bicycle out of the way.
It's rather unique.
He was made to wait at the station for two hours.
Tom doesn't sleep here.
Why is she burning her novel?
This is the more useful of the two.
Who made this box?
I knew him personally.
I can't live without a TV.
The ship slowly started to move.
The war brought ruin to the country.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
The worst of it has already happened.
Don't tell lies.
Tom says he can't believe anybody.
Is he satisfied with his daily life?
Tom opened the freezer and got out the ice cream.
I had left the key in the office the day before.
You must not forget to check your paper before you hand it in.
He's unable to do that.
I want to visit the Philippines.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert.
It never occurred to me that Tom might not be telling the truth.
Let's not talk about my problems.
Tom is going to be a doctor.
Is this book Takeo's?
Is it true that you brought your dog to the office?
This city has been increasing in population year after year.
I think about Tom often.
He handed the salesclerk the money.
Who are you laughing at?
Tom knows that Mary still isn't telling him everything.
My father is rich.
Get the bicycle out of the way.
I don't want to talk about music.
Tom is very unhappy about what has happened.
He's still at work.
Tomorrow, I have plans to go to Tokyo.
A lot of people are dealing with allergies now.
Please tell them what they need to do.
He is in front of the door.
The tree blocked the road.
Are you freaking crazy or just plain stupid?
He earned it.
I won't go unless I have to.
She hadn't noticed the cold until she opened the door.
Your pen sucks.
Tom would punch and kick his son for just any reason.
It's no secret.
These cars are made in Japan.
I hit him on the chin.
They are not interested in other languages.
Are you cold?
The situation called for quick, decisive action.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was honest.
The sun will set tonight at 6:03.
No doubt he will come later.
Why are you touching my girlfriend?
He is not my friend.
I can play the guitar.
Is using fingers uncivilized?
Tom needs the money desperately.
She didn't show up at the party, but nobody knows why.
I'm taking them some food.
Tom is leaving in the morning.
Tom isn't going to prison.
He works in the lab.
When are you picking it up?
Would you like to know who that beautiful woman is?
Tom and I are married to each other.
There's definitely something else.
Are they friends of yours?
I got a letter from her.
Most schools were designed not to transform society, but to reproduce it.
Tom was rescued by Mary.
I thought Tom would agree.
I didn't go to Hong Kong by plane.
How did you know Tom was good at golf?
Thanks, Mike. I don't like chicken.
You too.
Fresh vegetables promote health.
He murders English.
I shall never tell it to anybody.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
I don't know.
Put it there.
Please help me.
She went to Paris in order to study art.
This is going to be a great day!
Don't worry, I can take it.
I hope everyone is safe.
I don't know why you don't like her.
Let's dine out for a change.
Personally, I liked this one.
Did you hurt yourself?
All the other windows are open.
Who's this message for?
Extremely loud music interrupted their conversation.
Two women sing.
Tell me where the wine is.
We need to be more aggressive.
We'll see you there.
We caught the ball.
Tom wasn't the first one to be eliminated.
I just hope it's not true.
The engine won't start.
You cannot outsmart destiny.
Is there anyone here who can speak English?
Tom seems stressed.
Why did you live in Kyoto last year?
He fell in love with a beautiful princess.
I thought I'd have another chance to do that.
I think you need to study a little harder.
I'll complain if I want to.
Tom is just an assistant.
You would never do that.
You shouldn't be jealous.
Who will take care of your cat then?
What time tomorrow morning would you like me to pick you up?
It is doubtful whether he will come or not.
I love arguing with Tom.
The office is full of competent people.
Where did you smell them?
Syracuse is one of the biggest and most beautiful cities of Sicily.
Well, what's the problem, Tom?
I want to go to Australia.
I'm tired of museums, - graveyards of the arts.
This golf course is not open to non-members.
I'm the one who rescued you.
I like Tom better.
Don't worry about others.
I have family in Los Angeles.
I want things to be different this time.
Don't risk insulting your boss.
That's the choice we made.
Is it possible to cry underwater?
I don't have a cat.
The house had a stone wall around it.
You're sick. You have to rest.
She was lucky to find her keys.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
I own this place.
The worst of it has already happened.
They helped each other.
Everyone refused to help me.
Let's unearth the garlics.
Why didn't you tell her that?
I recognized your voice right away.
This medicine may cure him.
Tom handed Mary a brown bag.
Do you still want us to meet?
Now's not the time to have that attitude!
A poor workman blames his tools.
I'd have to be an idiot to do that.
We must stop this.
Well, it's getting late. Let's go now.
He is capable as a lawyer.
Look at Tom's face.
So, are you seeing anyone?
I didn't kiss him. He kissed me.
We've made a decision.
How can I see you?
It won't last forever.
Why didn't you tell her that?
Shut up and take my money!
I did what was right.
Do you think you can do it?
I'll try to be there by 2:30.
A bus pulled up in front of the hotel.
Tom isn't the only one not sitting.
This is all I ever wanted to do.
Where exactly did you go?
That is not my fault.
Happy birthday!
All my friends will be there.
Tom thought Mary wasn't happy.
They haven't seen the likes of it.
Next week, I will probably read a book and watch TV.
Tom sold Mary his car.
They shook hands with each other.
The day turned out to be fine.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
That book is mine.
I lost everything.
We have many members.
I'm going to lie down for a minute.
When are you picking it up?
I'm not sure you'll have the time to do that.
The women are very supportive.
We do like him.
Who gave you these?
Tell us about your childhood.
The book is big.
Nobody's accusing you of a crime.
I live near a dam.
First we'll eat, and then we'll go.
Does your mother know?
I don't want to go with her.
He prefers the quiet.
Tom helped me find my way here.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
I will stay there.
It serves you right.
Don't rely on others.
The light became weaker and weaker.
He was delighted to see you.
Tom sat at the bar, just staring at his drink.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
I've got to stop you.
Did you see a doctor?
Teaching asks for a lot of patience.
She is a very refined lady.
I never lie to you.
Their job is to fry the potatoes.
I think I know why Tom isn't here.
She finally arrived!
I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face.
Tom has family problems.
I was very skeptical.
I still want to play.
Tom said that he'd make it on time.
As long as you do what you've been told, we'll have absolutely no problem.
He knows how to bet.
I have observed him for many months.
What he said embarrassed me.
The child was scared to get into the water.
If I were you, I'd go.
I had a telephone call from her.
You can't hurt me anymore.
We've arrived a little late.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
She is not being careful.
I told you that I wasn't interested.
I think it's time for us to start getting ready.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Keep watch on him.
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
Why do you ask me of all people?
I thought Tom wasn't very good at French.
When I got home, I realized I had lost my wallet.
We can't trust Tom with something like this.
He will go to New York next month.
I never promised you anything.
You did not make a single mistake? That had to be blind luck!
Did you hear that, Mike?
I was very skeptical.
Tom passed away on Monday.
Would you mind if I open the window?
The boat began to take in water and soon sank.
No doubt she will come soon.
I had my house painted.
He managed to get himself promoted last week.
If I were you, I'd go.
I'm now watching Russia Today.
The engine won't start.
Didn't Tom tell you I was dying?
I cleaned up after the party.
Some people believe in God and other people don't.
Do I need dentures?
It seems that Tom has no idea where Mary is.
I don't owe Tom any explanations.
The teacher kicked her out of class.
There are many possible explanations.
I'll take it outside.
Leave it be, Tom.
We have other things to discuss.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
Tom reads a lot.
Tom was fingerprinted by the police.
Could you knock a little off the price?
Napoleon is remembered for his establishment of France's Napoleonic Code, which has had a great influence on the legal systems of other countries. In the US, for example, the legal system of the State of Louisiana is based on the Napoleonic Code.
I'm not ready for it yet.
What do we do with it?
I won't ask.
He answered in tears.
Let's start right away.
What he said embarrassed me.
Please move back.
Many moons ago, I was a seaman.
Did you call me last night?
What has he done?
She kept it hidden from me.
What's the number?
I wish you a quick recovery.
Did you see a doctor?
That's the choice we made.
I just hope nothing goes wrong this time.
Nobody is in the living room, but the TV is on.
Fire! Run!
Let me find out.
Great minds think alike.
We do like him.
Nobody does that.
Tom saw Mary hiding behind the door.
You bought a coat yesterday, didn't you?
I won't do it anymore.
This is all I need.
I know where this is leading.
Keep watch on him.
Put the chair in front of the desk.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
He lacks the talent to be an actor.
I'm tired of museums, - graveyards of the arts.
Let's go and find Tom.
You bought me a beer, remember? Now, let me buy you one.
Mostar is a very beautiful city.
Tom, you sound terrible.
We suffered a loss of 10,000 dollars.
Why should I talk to them?
Tom is quite right.
What pretty flowers!
I want to join you.
You're lucky Tom didn't come.
We could see nothing but fog.
Nobody wanted to mention my country.
What products are currently on sale?
I can't put up with that noise.
Saturday is the last day of week.
Do you remember how we met?
Tom's response was immediate.
It is doubtful whether he will come or not.
Good night, everyone!
Their job is to fry the potatoes.
Tom shouldn't have said that.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
It is estimated that a great number of his inventions remain unknown to date.
That's a waste of time and money.
Please call a taxi.
We've had some good times.
Tom doesn't look too well.
We certainly can't blame you.
He makes a lot more money than I do.
We've made a decision.
I love talking to people.
This is the most interesting.
It won't be your fault if your son does anything wrong: he is twenty-five now, isn't he?
You're the one who knows how to do this.
Tom walked toward the far wall.
Tom passed away on Monday.
Never say that.
You're the only one here who thinks it's a good idea to do that.
Everybody knows she married him for his money.
I respect my uncle, so I named my first son John after him.
Do you have a map of the city of Kyoto?
If he'd been alone at that time, he'd have died.
There's often a simple solution to what seems like a complicated problem.
I was ready for it.
I didn't break in.
I'd like to try this.
He parted from me saying that he would see me the next day, but I have not heard from him since.
Who was Mona Lisa?
I was badly in need of his help at that time.
Look around you.
I'm the one who rescued you.
Do you know where the bathroom is?
The time is always right to do what's right.
Swedish is easy.
Who is in this room?
Tom couldn't bear the pain any more so he shot himself.
Don't give away my secret.
He is capable as a lawyer.
Tom has been missing three weeks.
Don't disturb us.
Two children are sitting on top of the fence.
Tom lied about his grade.
Where are the book and the pencil?
Why is everybody in here?
Let's take a short pause.
They're drunk.
Is it OK if I open a can?
