No.
I'd like you to talk to Tom.
I like astrology.
Tom won.
I'll be back at ten.
She explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
I like grapes, but I can't eat too many of them.
Are you all right?
I'll return to Australia in two days.
Tom is also a vegetarian.
I'm at the library.
Does this bus go to the museum?
What time does the train reach Osaka?
They quarreled.
Tom screamed.
Are those yours?
I'm not proud of that.
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time.
I don't believe it!
How are you?
I am going to America by plane.
I won't come.
Obviously, Tom hasn't told anyone about us yet.
I want the blanket.
We were waiting for Tom.
Wake up.
He wants to dance.
Tom sighed.
I want to talk to Tom alone.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Could you write down the address, please?
I accepted his invitation.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Stop gossiping.
She can say whatever she wants.
Tom was elected in 2013.
May I open the window?
We're screaming.
Don't stand.
He can speak Japanese.
I am your friend, right?
Do you know what he said?
Tom doesn't look very happy.
What did Tom give to you?
How often do the buses run?
I can come at three.
It is just a matter of personal taste.
I didn't know Tom had a dog.
Call the police!
She is a reliable person.
I want to get off at the next stop.
My tooth hurts.
I'm looking for a mango to eat.
Nice to see you again.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
I'm going to check out at eight.
You need friends.
Don't open that.
I love apples.
Don't look.
You ought to see a dentist.
I like him.
I teach here.
Well, see you later.
I may give up soon and just nap instead.
Nobody is speaking.
Where do I claim my baggage?
What time does it close?
The cake is delicious.
Don't call me.
I don't know when I'll be back.
Our train leaves at eight-thirty.
Drive slowly.
Tom visited Boston.
He is having lunch now.
A lot of people say Tom is the best player on our team.
Tom keeps his word.
Have you finished it?
Tom certainly plays the guitar well.
Have you ever done that?
I tried.
We'll wait.
How do you pronounce this word?
This is your key.
I just don't know what to say.
Tom is watching a movie on his computer.
Stop yelling.
How old was he?
Arabic is a very important language.
You need friends.
He's younger than me.
It's pitch black outside.
Everyone was screaming.
This house is my grandfather's.
I used to write songs all the time.
I am well.
What was inside?
We were studying all afternoon.
Where does Tom live?
Tom doesn't want to give up.
Can you speak French?
I agree.
Take it.
I went to the bakery.
Just try to keep calm.
Tom wants to speak with you.
I took a lot of pictures.
Like it or not.
Nobody was home.
What is your name?
Where would Tom go?
You may use my new car.
Don't go in the kitchen.
Tom understood.
Tom's wounded.
I bought it last week.
Santa lives at the North Pole.
Don't hurt me.
Tom picked up the broken pieces of glass off the floor.
Tom is still in prison.
Tom coughed again.
May I put it here?
Do you understand?
No problem!
They were all happy.
I'll never stop.
She smiled.
Could you please repeat it once again?
Do you have a bicycle?
Take Tom outside.
Language is a means of communication.
Do you understand now?
It's only blood.
Forget him.
I don't know what you mean.
Give me the sword.
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time.
Tom saw him.
Muiriel is 20 now.
I like math.
He can speak French.
Tom didn't want Mary to wear any jewelry.
I need to send a fax.
I'm going to go.
Why are you screaming?!
You may write in any language you want. On Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
I don't get it.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
I'm reading it now.
I'm not leaving.
There is a mistake in the bill.
Is this your car?
I want more.
Give me liberty or give me death.
My elbow really hurts. I guess I should go to a hospital.
Unbelievable!
The rumor isn't true.
It's unbelievable.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
How much is this watch?
You're probably wondering how I found out about that.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Turn left at the corner.
I am only joking.
He speaks French.
Tom inhaled.
They don't care.
Is he a doctor?
Call a doctor.
I haven't forgotten.
Those roses are very beautiful.
I didn't have it.
I live near here.
This is her house.
Don't sing.
Why do you want to hurt Tom?
What's this?
He's a doctor.
Is there a discount for students?
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Don't underestimate us.
I still love Tom.
Please show me that.
Now fix that.
I know Tom is tired.
Tom exaggerates.
I have a good French dictionary.
Eat everything.
I'm three years older than you.
Ask again later.
This product was made in China.
I like yellow.
Where is my luggage?
We'll scream.
Does Tom understand French?
I ran away.
Tom swims well.
I forgot his phone number.
Tom is in his office.
I was outside.
My shoulders hurt.
What does it cost?
She went to Paris to see her aunt.
Call us.
Is this Tom's book?
Tom shouted.
They yelled.
Did you see him go out?
They screamed.
I am eating bread.
Do you have time?
Come and see for yourself.
I was away.
Are seats available?
I know this.
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
Tom left without saying a word.
Would you like to come fishing with us?
Let me in.
Where's the nearest public phone?
I know a store where you can buy that.
How can I get to the police station?
I'm yours.
Don't worry about me.
Bring food.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
I'm not sure as to when he will turn up.
I'll be back when I'm done.
Tomorrow I will return to Japan.
Nobody is indispensable.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
Everyone's there.
Tom is in heaven now.
All three were killed.
Where are you?
Is the lake deep?
He runs.
I'll get off at the next station.
Is he a teacher?
Don't change the channel.
I don't cry.
Send me there.
Tom came here.
Tom isn't at home.
How could they forget us?
Where's the knife?
I don't want to go to work today.
It's a pity when somebody dies.
She's my wife.
Tom sent Mary a letter.
Tom has his own apartment.
She got mad.
Who is it?
She is my mother.
Don't underestimate me.
My hip hurts.
Were you there?
I can manage this.
I can't lift my right arm.
There's no doubt.
That's MY line!
I'd like to reserve a seat on this train.
What are your thoughts on that?
I want something cold to drink.
Do you have Japanese newspapers?
I don't like these remarks.
There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, fall and winter.
I have a new red car.
Keep an eye on the door.
He tries.
I was in the mountains.
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Eat!
How long will you stay here?
Do not forget about us.
When do you usually go to bed?
Which hat is yours?
I'll stay here until ten.
He can speak Japanese.
I am sneezing.
The rice is yummy.
They visited me occasionally.
It's not mine.
Wait here.
Have you ever done that?
Anything else?
Where can I buy it?
Drink up your milk.
I don't use Facebook anymore.
My father is young.
I'll drive.
Keep it.
How is your daughter?
What time do you usually get up?
He had one daughter.
Everyone saw it.
How long have you been living in Boston?
Attack!
Tom has been to Boston several times.
What size shoes do you wear?
I love to travel.
I don't like coffee.
Everyone saw it.
Tom is a player.
We were playing in the park.
Everyone was screaming.
Definitely!
Tom hardly ever keeps his word.
What he said is not true.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom is a bit shorter than Mary.
I only speak French at home with my parents.
I know your name.
I've been there.
Tom reads lots of books.
Don't sing.
He's eating lunch now.
He eats too much.
Is this seat vacant?
He's a doctor.
What am I eating?
Tom is outside.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Definitely!
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Go to the hospital.
How embarrassing!
Everybody saw it.
Tom stared at Mary from across the room.
I'm lost.
I am going to stay here for a couple of days.
She is a doctor.
Are you all ready?
What time do you eat lunch?
Is the book boring?
Was Tom here?
Who doesn't want to win?
Tell me.
No, thank you.
How old is your grandfather?
Where are the photos?
Show me your passport, please.
He has three daughters.
This chair is ugly.
"Do you speak German?" "No, I don't."
They don't care.
Tom is thinking of going to Boston next spring.
Tom also plays guitar.
Speaking.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
Don't fight.
What are you here for?
Tom began coughing.
Here's your key.
Ken beat me at chess.
I was amazed.
You are not eating anything.
She has two daughters.
I am your friend, right?
Would you like to come in?
Some people started laughing.
I'm in the hospital.
You go first.
What time does it close?
Drink up your milk.
I'll cook.
Someone came.
What's your favorite television program?
You go first.
I'm sorry!
He had one daughter.
Tom was screaming.
I'm a student.
Leave Tom.
I'm a student.
My glass is full.
Are we eating out tonight?
It is midday.
Try hard.
Wolves won't usually attack people.
I'll be back.
I live in Japan.
I'm resting my legs.
Noodles are usually made from wheat.
Let me go!
Tom got mad.
Nothing happened.
How long have you been living in Boston?
Would you like to come in?
How long does it take to walk to the station?
You are tired, aren't you?
Where do you live?
Where do you want to go?
I don't blame you.
Does Tom know you're here?
She can speak Japanese.
Have you ever heard Tom speaking French?
Leave it.
Who's speaking?
I have three daughters.
Tom is alone in the dining room with Mary.
Where can I buy books?
What time does your plane leave?
I'm tired.
Are you a doctor?
Please stay here.
My father smokes.
I lost your phone number.
I'm Tom's mom.
I can't tell one twin from the other.
Were you there?
What time does this train reach Yokohama?
Tom is coming.
I was stunned.
I don't want to cook.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
Can you get my bill ready?
I want you to work with Tom.
Keep an eye on the door.
Watch this.
They screamed.
Eat whatever you want.
Football is the most popular sport in Brazil.
That was the best day of my life.
We both know this isn't right.
Today is the hottest day this year.
He got angry.
I thought Tom was in Boston.
They were all happy.
I do not understand you.
I'm fine.
He eats too much.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
I'll be back in a minute.
Don't go.
Here is the bill.
I'm busy.
Wait over there.
We'll help.
He coughed.
Tom held his breath for one minute.
Get Tom.
Speak more slowly.
I found his house easily.
I eat everything.
I yelled.
This is like fighting someone with one arm tied behind your back.
I'm sick.
Tom saw her.
Any student can answer that question.
I'll arrange it.
Here is the bill.
The article is terrible.
Keep Tom away from me.
May I eat?
How can I get to the station?
Tom began screaming.
Everyone was there.
Tom voted.
It's ten o'clock.
She is my daughter.
Tom is tall, but not as tall as I am.
He told me he would go to Venice.
I'm just joking.
They won.
How can I get to the nearest post office?
Do come again.
I like reading mystery novels.
Tom came back to Boston last October.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Tom's tired.
I don't want to go back.
It seems interesting to me.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
That's mine.
Why do you want to hurt Tom?
What's that?
What is your phone number?
I'm thirsty.
I'm just kidding.
The train arrived on time, so we didn't have to wait at all.
Have you ever broken a bone?
Do you have a car?
We traveled on foot.
I totally agree.
Tom came to Boston when he was thirteen years old.
At first, they were all convinced he was innocent.
I watch television.
They yelled.
Speak up!
Have fun.
I'm really angry.
What are you doing?
Got it?
Someone coughed.
"Do you speak German?" "No, I don't."
What time is it?
He is having lunch now.
They yelled.
Eat something.
I'll ask around.
I give up. No matter what I do, you never seem to be satisfied.
He knows where we live.
Eat anything you like.
Where's Mum?
That's not possible.
Tom came right away.
I'm home.
Tom ran.
Get up.
I used to be able to play that song.
Hurry up.
I only speak Italian.
Wait right here.
Once again.
I've forgotten her name.
It's too low.
A little competition is good.
Tom knows it.
How much does it cost for one person?
Your answer is right.
I would like you to come with me.
I heard yelling.
She walks.
I'm not your friend.
Turn right.
I need evidence.
I want to ask you about Tom.
He ran.
I am not your friend.
My father can fly an airplane.
It's two o'clock.
Get lost!
I changed my name to Tom Jackson.
I want more detailed information.
Ghosts exist.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
He looks pale.
He can come.
I'm resting my legs.
Take it outside.
When do you usually go to bed?
How old is he?
Which cap is yours?
I got on the train for London.
Go slow.
How old was she?
Don't sing.
To purchase a ticket, you need to enter your personal details.
Good night.
Tom has been wounded.
You won.
It's me.
Tom has died.
When do you want to go?
Don't wait.
Tom waited on the platform.
Humans can't see ultraviolet light.
Let's walk.
Tom did that himself.
What's the point in doing this?
I've done some things I'm not proud of.
This is new.
Tom nodded.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
I don't think Tom is responsible for that.
The same thing happened three years ago in Boston.
He came.
He knows where we live.
The balloon will burst.
What are you doing?
Let's go!
I'm not working.
The letter was written.
Don't forget the ticket.
Where are your things?
You're my daughter.
Does it stop at Kolkata?
What are you here for?
Come here.
Drive slowly.
My father drives very well.
Everyone liked Tom.
Let go of me.
I would never have guessed that.
Nobody's there.
See below.
I want three pairs of socks.
I am sneezing.
How can I get to the hospital by bus?
What is its cost?
Do you have a car?
French isn't difficult to learn.
That's my brother.
I can beat you.
You are my daughter.
Tom can't read.
Everyone went to sleep.
Take good care of yourself.
I forgot to telephone him today.
They visited me occasionally.
Tom saw you.
Tom was there.
Let's talk.
Why were you absent from school yesterday?
Tom has been injured.
The government lightened taxes.
This train stops at every station.
He hasn't arrived yet.
Good night!
You ought to see a dentist.
Go away!
This train stops at every station.
I have a three-year contract.
Tom shouldn't have gone out after dark by himself.
I'm looking for a room for rent.
I'm your friend.
What time is your plane?
Trust me.
Have you gone mad?
I need a friend.
I have an old computer that I don't want anymore.
We would like to stay here tonight.
May I have your phone number?
Ask me tomorrow.
Can he speak French?
We were waiting for you.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
I ran outside.
Spring has come.
I am okay.
Come towards me.
Really?
The hospital opened last month.
See above.
I work here.
I'll stay close.
Where can I buy it?
It is very near.
I'm not a doctor.
Could you please repeat it slowly?
I couldn't walk.
Don't go.
I lost your phone number.
Do you understand me?
Tom clapped.
I totally agree.
I want to be more independent.
What's happened?
My son can't count yet.
Puzzles are fun.
Take me to the hospital.
Why don't you try to take your money back?
I want Tom brought here now.
How did you come to know her?
Tom frowned.
Listen carefully.
I don't like this.
Call the hospital.
What's your full name?
You deserve the prize.
Let's play football!
I'll come back for you.
Any child can do that.
Don't move these books.
We all want Tom to be happy.
This pen doesn't write well.
Listen carefully.
Stay right there.
Hold the candle.
Please wake me at six.
I used to swim in this river.
The day after tomorrow is Tom's birthday.
The bus stop is five minutes' walk from here.
Speak!
Could you give me the bill, please?
Another day passed.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
Call a doctor.
It is just half past seven.
One of them is a spy.
Sorry I didn't reply to your message earlier, I was busy.
Is Tom all right?
Have you ever heard Tom speaking French?
Is that your book?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I don't like to cook.
You should know better.
Leave Tom.
What time do you usually eat lunch?
How many nights will you stay?
Tom continued yelling.
Tom used to be scared of dogs.
Tom kept screaming.
Tom is dreadfully wrong.
Everybody ran outside.
It wasn't until I heard him speak that I recognized him.
Have you ever visited Boston?
Can you read?
Wait right here.
Don't wait.
What do bees eat?
I can't attend the meeting.
Tom wants to speak with you.
What time does the ship leave?
Who is he?
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I want a guitar.
Be quiet.
Anybody here?
Send it by mail.
I'm really confused.
Now listen carefully.
Why was Tom crying?
One of them is a spy.
Your book is on the desk.
You may choose whichever you want.
Stand up.
I'm Tom.
I am going to work.
Tom burped.
What time does it open?
I'll take those.
I agree with you.
Tom seems to know quite lot about baseball.
Is this your book?
Here's your mug.
I am not thirsty.
The experiment failed.
I can speak French, but only a little bit.
Tom saw her.
Find Tom.
Stop here.
I fell in love with him.
Do you understand me?
Can you show me on the map?
I don't want Tom to find me.
Visit our website for additional information.
She was wearing a black hat.
Is Tom doing okay?
There's no way I'm leaving you here alone with Tom.
They screamed.
Open your mouth!
Have you ever seen the person in this photo?
Tell me what you want.
I had nothing to say to Tom.
And you?
Eat everything.
No one is laughing.
I ate noodles for the first time today.
Grab my hand.
You would have to practice the violin every day.
You can eat whatever you like.
My feet hurt.
What would you like to eat?
I want to go abroad.
Listen.
What time do you usually get up?
Tom is wearing headphones.
Come quick!
There's no mistake.
Is he a teacher?
Who wants to eat now?
We've done worse.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Tom's injured.
We'll be at home today.
We need help immediately.
I blame Tom for all of this.
He hasn't come yet.
Tom has never been so happy.
Who doesn't want to win?
I feel hungry.
I'm a woman.
Go back outside.
I do not think there will be rain tomorrow.
The room charge is $100 a night plus tax.
My arm hurts.
We are Arabs.
Tom and Mary are very happy.
Allow me to go.
I have a cough and a little fever.
Tom jumped.
The chicken was delicious.
Nothing happened.
Don't move!
It's what I'm used to.
I am 30 years old now.
Tom began to shout.
I wouldn't be calling if it weren't important.
What are you doing?
Some people started laughing.
Is anybody here?
I only have one blanket.
There's no more time.
Tom is as big as I am.
I went aboard.
I don't agree with him.
Do you have anything to declare?
Do you have any others?
Do you have any plans right now?
Eat something.
Grab Tom.
We have failed.
I don't want to look at Tom.
Would you like to come inside?
Tom has seen it.
Tom is one of the most generous people I ever met.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
I understand your situation.
Where's Tom been?
Tom flew to Boston yesterday.
I have a brother.
I'm a detective.
May I ask a question?
Another possibility occurred to Tom.
She accompanied me to the hospital.
He tries.
Is there any possibility that he'll win the election?
Are you worried?
Tom asked me where Mary lived.
Tom nodded his head.
I'm not tired at all.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
Tom's dreaming.
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
What time does the train leave?
We have to try.
I'm 17, too.
Tom hardly ever keeps his word.
Tom has decided to keep a diary.
Have you ever been to Boston?
Is that so?
Don't hurt me.
I got up at seven this morning.
Tom started screaming.
This material stretches easily.
She's younger than me.
In life there are ups and downs.
How much will it be?
How old is your father?
I found my mother busy ironing out some shirts.
You look very pale.
Life is beautiful.
Tom began screaming.
They eat healthy foods.
What's that?
This isn't a good sign.
Would you like to come?
Listen carefully.
Try hard.
I forget your phone number.
Nobody was injured.
Can I ask you some questions?
I tried.
What's your favorite television program?
I was waiting for them.
Tom is taking a big chance.
Eat something.
This can't wait until tomorrow.
You may write in any language you want. On Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
Help me!
Is there an elevator?
Where is the entrance to the museum?
Refrigerators help to preserve food.
I'm at a loss for words.
Tom eats very quickly.
Drive carefully.
Don't speak to Tom like that.
Times are changing.
Do you want to eat now or later?
I love solving puzzles.
You should know better.
I apologise for arriving late.
The sky is clear.
Mr. Suzuki studied French before he went to France.
Have you finished it?
Did you go anywhere for the summer?
Don't stand.
When do you want to go?
Forget him.
Everybody laughed.
What does it mean?
We'll just have to ask Tom to do it for us, won't we?
There are two hundred pages.
Don't open that.
Who's she?
Tom has written more than 300 songs.
Tom has given us so much.
What is your age?
I can swim across the river.
Christmas is just a few days away.
He runs.
How do you keep so calm?
I don't want to go with Tom.
I accepted his invitation.
He was giving a speech.
It's hot today.
We're winning.
Who cares?
Tom certainly is eloquent.
Please hurry up.
It's a pineapple.
I've been hoping you would drop in.
I'm inside.
I got it.
Get away from here.
I have two nieces.
Do you understand?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
You'll never be alone.
I don't want Tom to hate me.
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
I wish I could swim.
Do you have this in any other colors?
You run.
He was speaking.
I'm OK.
Meat should not be eaten raw.
We actually saw the accident.
Why can't you come?
Tom could see that Mary was crying.
Tom is hurt.
Were you born there?
He hasn't arrived yet.
Let me handle this.
It's October the third.
Who came?
I don't know who killed Tom.
This amulet brings me luck.
Tom brought this.
It seems that I've lost my keys.
I'll wait.
Forget him.
Thank you, Doctor.
He's sleeping like a baby.
We've done that.
She walks.
Tom coughed loudly.
I'm full.
They are doctors.
Forget Tom.
Forgive Tom.
What does that mean?
My father is out.
Tom rides a scooter.
I am not a teacher.
Tom's homeless.
What time does the airport bus leave?
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.
Mount Everest is, so to speak, the roof of the world.
Tell me what you want.
Tom lives there.
Come and see for yourself.
My father swims very well.
Stop!
You can wait here.
Are you all ready?
Can you play the piano?
That's my cat.
Would you like to come in?
I like rice.
Where's the hospital?
I did my work.
Is Tom satisfied?
How much did you eat?
Do you know what he said?
Your shoes are here.
Try again.
He came.
Why can't you come?
I'd like to check out right now.
Let me speak.
I haven't done this for years.
Tell me.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Are you there?
I don't get it.
How beautiful you are!
Do you speak English?
Have you ever ridden a horse?
My house has a fruit garden.
I'm still your friend.
Please hurry.
It's just blood.
Don't come in.
Aren't you a doctor?
Keep Tom there.
You're so impatient with me.
Don't jump!
Start here.
How many people in your party?
I will work.
We speak French.
They're inside.
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts.
I am shy.
I think Tom only speaks French.
