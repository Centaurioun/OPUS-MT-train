How beautiful you are!
Start here.
Tom is a Canadian citizen.
Do it again!
My son came to my room.
I'm eating now.
Most Japanese eat rice every day.
What've you found?
How old is she?
It's not important.
Science has many branches.
Tom's crying.
Are we ready?
Mom, I don't want to go!
I am still eating.
I want you to work with Tom.
Stay there.
I am your friend.
What is his age?
Maybe it will snow.
Please wait till he comes back.
I'm your friend.
I'm going to be late.
Have you gone mad?
I want to cry.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
Would you please fill out this form?
I am a Briton.
Do you speak English?
Are there many Chinese restaurants in Boston?
Do you live in this neighborhood?
I would like you to come with me.
Control yourself!
Tom laughs a lot.
He is a very important person.
Do you have a larger size?
Come here.
You look sick.
Don't come.
We'll work.
Don't stop here.
Do you need a deposit?
Tom has decided to keep a diary.
How do you keep so calm?
Is it a direct route?
What time did Tom call?
Come with me.
How could you leave a four-year-old child all alone?
Would you like to come fishing with us?
Tom began screaming.
What is the meaning of that word?
I'm doing great.
I'm screaming.
I screamed.
How old is she?
Come quick!
Tom wanted to know the time.
I don't know Tom personally.
Who wants to be a millionaire?
I'm happy to see you again.
What are you doing?
Yesterday was my seventeenth birthday.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
Tom ran.
Would you like something to drink?
Tom certainly is good-looking.
I have returned.
I don't want it anymore.
What's your name?
What are you going to be when you grow up?
What's your home address?
Go wait outside.
What would you like to eat?
Can you speak French?
You should know better.
Why are you shouting?
That's my wife.
She is younger than me.
Leave Tom.
Tom used to be scared of dogs.
See you later.
Nobody remembers.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
He neglects his studies.
This is his house.
I want to buy pineapples.
Please tell me your phone number.
I'm for it.
I was away.
Come back.
Will it rain tomorrow?
You don't understand.
Use this.
I was momentarily blinded.
You've known Tom a lot longer than I have.
Leave town.
I'm reading.
Get out.
Stand up!
There are three buttons.
Do you live here?
Help!
Tom wants to know who we are.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
How can I get to the zoo from here?
Who's he?
I'll sleep here.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
Tom certainly is hypocritical.
How long did you stay?
I'm going to scream.
Let us in.
Who wants some hot chocolate?
My luggage is in the boot.
I see something.
Tell Tom I'll be back.
I wrote a letter.
Go away!
I've been hoping you would drop in.
Take me to the hospital.
Tom always keeps his promises.
What's your father's name?
Pass me the salt, please.
It's because you don't want to be alone.
Everyone saw it.
Tom still has a few options.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
It isn't mine.
I found his house easily.
How much do I owe you?
He eats nothing else but fruit.
Keep quiet.
What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
I saw that.
Thank you, this will do.
I'm so mad.
Don't ask.
She's my wife.
Come in.
You are always complaining.
I asked Tom where he'd gone.
She was raised in France.
Who is she?
How far is it from here?
Do you understand what I mean?
I like him.
Stay here.
Tom yawned.
Mary decorated the cake.
We don't have that information.
Tom is waiting impatiently.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
What am I doing?
Why do you want to hurt Tom?
Please fill out this form.
Tom saw you.
Excuse me, what time is it?
My mother can't come.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom is taller than Mary.
Why aren't you coming with us?
I need a box about this big.
He is eating.
What'd I do?
Do whatever he tells you.
I am your friend, right?
I've learned a lot from you.
Ask Tom.
You can study here.
Where are you?
This bag is mine.
Do you understand now?
I'll talk.
An enemy of an enemy is not necessarily an ally.
Americans call football soccer.
I ran home.
Is your watch correct?
She is eating.
Tom is sick.
I'll come along.
Everybody lies.
She's asking how that's possible.
I should've talked to Tom first.
I'm downstairs.
I love to travel.
Who came?
Mary ran.
I will be back soon.
I love you.
Eat what you want.
Look behind you.
I don't see you.
Is there a nonstop flight to New York?
Congratulations!
I know that story.
What time do you eat lunch?
Does this car go to Jingan temple?
Where is the boy?
I heard you scream.
I was late to school.
This room has air conditioning.
It's fifteen minutes on foot.
You are always complaining.
It's time to go.
What is the meaning of that word?
They were all happy.
The museum is closed now.
How old is your grandfather?
I have to go to the store first.
How many nights will you stay?
Tom was crying like a baby.
I'll be back in two hours.
I've heard that.
What am I hearing now?
Add more water.
Read this first.
Is Tom dreaming?
I can't.
Have you ever seen the person in this photo?
He knows where we live.
Is that blood?
She eats nothing other than fruit.
Are you worried?
Tom kept interrupting me.
Tom can read French.
You ought to ask him for advice.
When is the next flight to Boston?
I don't like that.
And you?
Tom drives.
What do you want?
I wonder what I should get you for your birthday.
I won't lose!
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Tom never comes here.
Do you mind my sitting next to you?
Is this book Tom's?
It's time to go.
We saw the airplane.
He told me he would go to Venice.
Tom works a lot.
Sit wherever you like.
Sit there.
Eat whatever food you like.
Ask Tom.
Tom came inside.
Help us.
We forgot.
Come towards me.
Don't speak.
I am here for twelve days.
Tom's yelling.
We're inside.
Don't forget the ticket.
Of course!
I've never seen Tom happier.
She got mad.
It's not always so easy to do the right thing.
Don't speak.
He coughed.
Eat the bread!
Nobody is speaking.
He was speaking.
Are you a taxi driver?
I do not talk in Japanese.
How much is it?
Turn left.
Is he a teacher?
How long do we stop here?
I can't believe I believed Tom.
Let's chat.
Tom disappeared.
What happened?
Mary is screaming.
Will you go to America next month?
They quarreled.
It's new.
I'll be back before you know it.
This computer runs on batteries.
They've got guns.
I was astonished.
What does this word mean?
What's your father's name?
Everyone screamed.
Nobody's indispensable.
My Internet connection is slow, but Tatoeba is slower.
Patience is essential for a teacher.
He wants to dance.
You run.
Few people understood his comment.
Tell me what happened.
How old are you?
Be careful.
It seems that I have lost my keys.
Tom is very methodical in the way he does his work.
How did you come to know her?
My father is always getting angry.
It's been snowing all night.
Is this seat taken?
Tom teaches me French.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
Tom's father is a musician.
In general, things are all right.
Tell me what happened.
We might as well stay here until it stops hailing.
I'll be back by evening.
Control yourself.
I don't understand you.
Sit there.
"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
What is its cost?
Why are you shouting?
Here's your mug.
Find Tom.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Turn right at the next intersection.
He loses his temper easily.
Don't scream.
I eat.
I'll ask around.
We'll try.
Is he a doctor?
Where will Tom go?
Just sign here.
Although it is not a bad thing in itself, in a lot of cases, many people are watching too much television.
I heard you scream.
Who'd want to hurt me?
I like noodles.
She's a good person.
Water is life.
Where is the Australian embassy?
I'm your friend.
I felt that.
Why don't we go home?
Everything is over.
How much does this cost?
How old is that?
I went to the hospital yesterday.
Count to thirty.
I saw him jump.
I'm poor.
I saw Mary sitting in front of a mirror brushing her hair.
These texts were written in Hebrew, not in Aramaic.
Tom was such a happy person.
This is my sister.
Did you read it all?
Tom started cursing in French.
Nothing changed.
I downloaded the file that Tom uploaded.
Thanks, that's all.
The rain lasted a week.
You fainted.
Use this.
My baggage is missing.
He's a doctor.
Tom squeezed the lemon.
Do you know a good dentist?
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
I am looking for a cheap hotel.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
I refuse.
Hit Tom.
Stand over there.
I found the book interesting.
I'd be grateful.
I want to send Tom a letter.
Call Tom.
Tom told me all about you.
We're lost.
Count to thirty.
"She likes music." "So do I."
Ask Alex.
I'm really embarrassed.
Help Tom.
Keep an eye on the door.
I don't understand what you are saying.
Could you take me to the Grand Hotel?
My father grows rice.
There are no problems.
This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
Do you hate me?
I don't want to go shopping alone.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
This is totally unacceptable.
Tom's alone.
How much does it cost?
She's my older sister.
Can we keep it?
My luggage has just arrived.
I'm yours.
I found that book interesting.
I don't know who killed Tom.
Tom disappeared.
Tom is dead.
I don't know if I have the time.
You're going the wrong way.
Tom's resting.
Can he speak French?
I missed the 7:00 train.
Eat whatever you like.
Please eat something.
I came back.
Call the police!
We love coffee.
What is my room number?
This handbag is mine.
She explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
My stomach hurts after meals.
Flowers bloom.
Don't you have a bicycle?
He speaks French.
He looks pale.
Tom Jackson has written three books.
I need to get off this ship.
Have you ever visited Boston?
Leave us.
I found his house easily.
Attention please!
Do you have any others?
What is your phone number?
My hobby is collecting old bottles.
I didn't notice.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
The ball was wet.
The soldiers surrounded the village.
They screamed.
Tom kept silent during dinner.
They were all happy.
I finally found my keys.
Where do you want to go?
Tom is still at school.
You go first.
Is Mary your daughter?
This is my wife.
Can you wait a minute?
Everyone else laughed.
We need to find a solution soon.
What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
I'd like to confirm my ticket.
What's the price?
Come and see for yourself.
I don't understand.
Tom always keeps his promises.
Can he speak French?
I don't understand you.
You may stay here as long as you like.
Can you speak French?
Mary knows nothing.
Goodbye!
We both know that's not true.
Tom is sick.
Don't talk.
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.
I don't want to go swimming.
I'm quite hungry.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
What time do you get up?
That's my wife.
Where did Tom call from?
I thought Tom was dead.
Drive carefully.
We were waiting for them.
Cut your nails.
May I start eating now?
Do you still read books?
Tom died.
Did you speak?
Because of the heavy fog, not a single person could be seen.
We have to be careful.
My book is here.
Communications broke down.
If I don't do it now, I never will.
What is the price?
Please put the meter on.
My luggage has been damaged.
Good morning, everybody.
Everybody saw it.
It is sunny today.
Come here!
Call me at six tomorrow morning.
Speak with me.
The soldiers occupied the building.
Where are you going on Monday?
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom's hiding something, too.
How many songs has Tom written?
Grab my hand.
Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow.
It is far away from here.
School starts Monday.
Tom saw them.
Tom is wounded.
Here's the bill.
I'm too busy.
Speak clearly.
I need a doctor!
You may stay here as long as you like.
Is this book yours?
When I was thirteen, someone told me I was really good at French.
She's asking how that's possible.
I don't see you.
I went on foot.
I hope I can talk in Lojban.
My father walks.
I can't say.
When is the museum open?
I didn't want to do that.
Tom wants me to go with him.
I am staying at a hotel in New York.
I wouldn't accept this bribe.
This is my daughter.
Would you like to eat something?
Nice to see you again.
I do understand.
Don't move!
You ought to ask him for advice.
Did you find your passport?
Don't you have a bicycle?
Wrong.
Tom picked up the newspaper and read the headlines.
How old is this tree?
He was very patient.
Stand up.
Tom'll speak.
I am sick.
Listen carefully.
You drive.
I want to know who did that.
Whose phone number is this?
Could you take a photo of me?
I'm still your friend.
Tom saw him.
Nobody here does that.
I'm still your friend.
Don't leave me alone.
Did Tom eat?
Do you understand what I want to say?
I'm going to a meeting.
I never realized how awful living all alone could be.
Everybody saw it.
Oh, really?
This room is air-conditioned.
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
Wake up.
This is completely my fault.
Everything's negotiable.
I do not understand you.
Tom was utterly humiliated.
That's rubbish.
Who is she?
I'm never wrong.
Don't underestimate me.
Here is your key.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
We're desperate to find a solution.
Pardon me?
I can't stand hospitals.
Tom is breathing normally.
Is this seat empty?
I gritted my teeth.
He spent the evening reading a book.
Let's get ready.
He can say whatever he wants.
You're screaming.
I don't live in the city.
Was Tom crying?
Come at two o'clock.
Forty people were present.
We made too many mistakes.
This is very good soil.
What he said is not true.
Eat the bread!
Tom saw him.
It's almost six.
Tom hardly ever laughs.
I heard coughing.
What's the meaning of that?
I'm pretty sure.
It looked cheap.
I used to play tennis.
Don't cry.
Really?
Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
Time is up.
What do you do?
Can I eat?
I am not a doctor.
Tom coughs a lot.
Would you like to come shopping with me?
I'm cold.
I don't deny it.
I can go.
Do you mind my sitting next to you?
Leave it.
I don't like you anymore.
Who wants to talk to me?
Get Tom.
Let me speak.
I don't know anything about Japan.
What's your full name?
How much is it?
I know that we still love each other.
Keep quiet!
Eat what you want.
Tom will be thirty next year.
It is mine.
What time does the train depart?
Why are you screaming?!
She didn't tell me her name.
Slow down.
May I use a credit card?
He's younger than me.
We'll win.
Hurry up.
I've forgotten his name.
He likes Italian food.
Would you like to come out and play?
I tried to swim across the river.
Tom was helping me.
I have a feeling that Tom doesn't like Mary.
What's this called in French?
I think you're sitting in my seat.
She got mad.
I didn't want to insult Tom.
Tom always keeps his promises.
Eat anything you like.
I'll scream.
Mary threw Tom under the bus.
Last week she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.
You may go there.
Tom screamed loudly.
Come with me.
I'm still your friend.
Do you want fruit juice?
Tom reluctantly went to the dentist.
The fan doesn't work.
Tom kept coughing.
The cake is ready.
How long is the train delayed?
I respect elderly people.
I'll start.
We speak French.
Don't go in the kitchen.
I understand.
How do you say that in Italian?
What did you forget?
I work on Mondays.
Do you understand me?
I heard a scream.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
We're stuck here.
Tom speaks fast.
How weird!
You look sick.
What does this mean?
He's in the hospital.
How can I get to gate A-1?
Stay at home.
Walk slowly.
Give Tom a kiss.
Tom's an irritating person to work with because he'll never admit it when he's made a mistake.
I don't want to go to work.
What time does the train for Boston leave?
Watch out for cyclists and pedestrians.
I don't want to go with Tom.
Help us.
I live here.
Who did Tom bite?
That's Tom.
How can I get to the airport?
Stop Tom.
Bob helped me.
Don't forget to invite Tom.
All Tom wants to do is fish.
At what time does it close?
Never mind!
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Consult a doctor.
I've been hoping you would drop in.
I'll keep watch.
Happy Canada Day!
I'd like you to call me Tom.
When were potatoes introduced into Japan?
I'd like to stay for one night.
I'll be present.
My mother cooks well.
This is the third longest river in the world.
We have three daughters.
Today is election day in Poland.
She has two daughters.
Some of them are teachers, and some are engineers.
Tom is very ill.
Everybody is very busy.
Stay at home.
Everybody liked Tom.
I've learned a lot from you.
You should apologize.
I asked Tom to come with me.
What time is it?
Tom resigned in October.
I've remarried.
Does the room have air conditioning?
Tom now lives in Boston.
I said nothing.
I'm broke.
Would you like some more?
I know what I will do.
Where are your things?
I'm an optimist.
Is this your car?
Do you have any vacancies?
I can't bend my right arm.
To me, it is easier writing about death than about life.
How many nights will you stay?
I've never told anyone about this.
I trust Tom.
I saw him.
Were you born there?
He only eats fruit.
She has two children.
Don't speak to Tom like that.
This is your key.
Tom saw them.
I think you're right.
If he had taken his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
Stop yelling.
Your answer is wrong.
Everyone uses Google.
Tom used to play guitar.
Football is a sport.
Everyone ignored Tom.
Do you eat meat?
Stop that woman.
I'm proud of my son.
Speak with me.
You look sick.
We love our country.
See you there.
Don't fight.
Do you want to eat now or later?
Why aren't you coming with us?
Does Tom know you're here?
I'm going to study French next year.
I'd like you to call me Tom.
I like him.
Follow Tom.
What exactly has Tom done?
How many nights will you stay?
Don't you think that Tom is a little young for you?
I don't care what he does.
He's eating lunch now.
Don't change sentences that are correct. You can, instead, submit natural-sounding alternative translations.
Please deposit the money in a bank.
Call Tom.
Don't talk!
Most people think I'm crazy.
I'd rather go swimming.
I understand your situation.
Here's your mug.
Do you still read books?
Let's ask.
I was concerned.
Spanish is her native language.
Before going to France, Mr. Suzuki studied French.
Why can't you come?
Tom started the fight.
They are doctors.
Tom kept his eyes closed.
I'll call first.
Stand up!
I try.
He decided not to go to the party.
I'm ready.
I'll stay here till you get back.
Tom has big eyes.
Tom found my bike.
We used to play in the park.
I'm really disappointed.
They need friends.
I forgot your phone number.
Tom started yelling.
This is never going to end.
Don't stand.
I helped Tony.
Tom told me all about you.
I do not want to reply to his letter.
Who is he?
He's sleeping like a baby.
I believe you both know Tom.
Speak!
It's five o'clock.
My right leg hurts.
He hasn't come yet.
I thought Tom was with Mary.
Finish this as soon as possible.
I am not your friend.
Eat the bread!
We're different.
She has very nice-looking handwriting.
I do not understand.
I was coughing.
Is that all?
You need a friend.
I want this guitar.
Have fun.
I know your name.
I'll come back for you.
Tom is used to hard work.
Can I see that one?
Leave me.
They say this old house is haunted.
We can still do that.
What number bus do I take to get to Waikiki?
Get away from here.
That's a book.
I'm really hungry, but I can't decide what I want to eat.
I don't want to be like that.
They don't care.
Would you like to come inside?
I agree completely.
I'm not denying it.
Forget Tom.
World War II ended in 1945.
Tom said Mary had given him permission to leave early.
Tom is going to sing.
This will cost €30.
I'll take him.
Look! There is a cat in the kitchen.
Run!
I fainted.
I see.
Forget about Tom.
I'm speaking.
Tom was arrested for drunken driving.
I want to ask you about Tom.
You need a friend.
My throat is a bit dry.
She got mad.
Tom wanted to visit America.
We are here.
I am here on business.
The library is to the left.
They won.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
I can ski.
I'm okay.
Tom slapped Mary.
Good morning, everyone.
I checked everywhere.
Where's your daughter?
Are those yours?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Finish it before you go to bed.
What time does the bus leave?
I want to ask Tom something.
You look very tired.
Have you ever been to Europe?
Tom kept silent all day long.
How can I get to the train station?
Tom tried to keep his chin up.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
How old is that?
You may swim.
He is a doctor.
This is the shortest way to the station.
My computer is very slow.
Tom tried to keep away from Mary.
This drives me nuts.
Follow Tom.
Tell Tom.
A river separates the city into east and west.
It may snow.
The hospital is near here.
I could not believe my eyes!
Tom's screaming.
This is my sister, Mary.
Tom is inside.
The ambassador returned.
The pillow isn't clean.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
It's a pineapple.
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
How tall you are!
She didn't tell me her name.
Go inside.
He's eating.
I am going to Osaka station.
What is today's date?
Tom kept screaming.
Anybody can make a mistake.
It is very hot today.
He can speak Japanese.
Can it be phrased in another way?
Tom's sick.
Is Tom here?
Come again?
Do you live here?
That's rather amusing.
It's already seven.
Mary is screaming.
She wants to dance.
Do you understand what he's saying?
You're too meddling.
How old is your grandfather?
Thanks, this is enough.
How much is that?
Sit down.
Eat whatever food you like.
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
I wanted this.
Tom tried to keep away from Mary.
How much does it cost to eat at such a place?
My back still hurts.
Tom is a farmer.
Hold your tongue!
He's younger than me.
Don't underestimate us.
Leave me.
Say it.
One language is never enough.
Have you ever been to Europe?
My son can read a clock.
Where can I claim my luggage?
He can say whatever he wants.
He got angry.
Then what?
Tom taught me to read.
Tom has been crying almost every day.
Ann came downstairs.
I'm just asking.
Can I get a blanket?
You should eat vegetables.
It seems to me that the train is late.
I like to eat.
Who would want to hurt Tom?
What time is it now?
Tom wants to go job hunting.
Leave Tom.
What does it mean?
I was born in October.
I don't like to drink coffee.
A friend loaned this book to me.
I'll see you next month.
He is an experienced teacher.
What language is spoken in America?
Do you want to eat noodles or rice?
We want complete sentences.
It's midday.
This is his house.
I was here in 2013.
Why are you sitting there?
Could you please sign the register?
Why not?
I was waiting for them.
Where's Boston?
I'll be back within an hour.
I always feel sleepy.
Sit wherever you like.
London is the capital of England.
Tom stopped talking as soon as he noticed Mary wasn't listening anymore.
Are you there?
How are you?
Tom washed the potatoes.
Consult your doctor.
He's a doctor.
Tom died last October.
Ask me tomorrow.
You ought to ask him for advice.
I heard you screaming.
Keep quiet.
I don't know.
My father was busy.
Is this real silver?
You sit here.
Don't shout.
May I see your passport, please?
I was astonished.
The summer vacation is over.
Tom has learned a valuable lesson.
John listened carefully.
Just try to keep calm.
Who ate?
She wants to dance.
I am able to read English.
I want to be as rich as Tom.
There's no salt.
Could we have a table outside?
What is the meaning of this word?
Birds fly.
Eat what you want.
Tom broke his nose.
I don't need to talk to Tom.
Tom loves me.
How much will I receive?
I'm shy.
They're children.
I'm also learning French.
I must've lost my key along the way.
I hear you have friends in the CIA.
Tom was reading the newspaper when Mary walked in.
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.
Rules are rules.
Please speak slowly.
Kiss Tom.
He's kicking me!
I don't like you anymore.
I caught a cold.
Who ran?
What is the population of India?
Could I have these clothes ironed?
Please deposit the money in a bank.
You run.
When you can't do what you want, you do what you can.
I didn't listen.
Tom yelled.
Earthquakes and floods are natural disasters.
Everyone was screaming.
May I open the windows?
Am I your first friend who's not Japanese?
It rained continuously for three days.
They're moving toward us.
Who's she?
The station is two miles away.
You are not eating anything.
Start now.
Who wants to come with me?
Tom kept an eye on the children.
I have class tomorrow.
Can you help me, please?
Who's she?
I asked Tom where he'd been.
Watch out!
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Answer me.
Please wait here.
I thought Tom was in danger.
You're welcome.
Wait outside.
"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
Tom likes chocolate cake a lot.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Everybody loved Tom.
I accepted his invitation.
It's fairly warm today.
Is he a doctor?
He decided not to go to the party.
Of course.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
You look very pale.
I'll never tell.
Watch out!
You shouldn't have gone into the forest alone.
My motorcycle is new.
Tom doesn't want to see you.
He is eating.
Tom resumed speaking.
He was giving a speech.
There's no more salt.
You are in my way.
I have a headache.
Why are you sitting there?
She is eating.
Which cap is yours?
Don't stop.
I have lost my money-bag.
Tom's parents were also singers.
We've seen them.
I didn't complain at all.
What a scream!
Forget him.
Stop yelling.
I'm not your friend.
Why are you yelling?
We tried.
Tom likes chess.
What a lovely day!
He's a good person.
Everyone started laughing.
Step aside.
What is your father's name?
I have evidence.
Don't talk.
My name is Tom.
I was a teacher.
Do you understand what I want to say?
Italians eat pasta.
Welcome.
She is having lunch now.
Tom slept on the train.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
They screamed.
Contact Tom.
I'm in the house.
We all work together.
Carlos turned around.
Tom went to the post office to mail a letter.
I know Tom was a friend of yours.
The terrorists released the hostages.
Why?
I'm pretty tired.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
What'll Tom bring?
Do you understand what I mean?
Go.
Tom threatened Mary.
Winning is never easy.
Do you think we can find someone to replace Tom?
Calm down.
I found this book interesting.
Look at Tom.
Tom tried to keep from smiling.
What did you say?
She's my wife.
They all screamed.
Stand up!
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
He runs.
I'm not thirsty.
My name was omitted from the list.
Tom needs a friend.
That cake was delicious.
Tom's sick.
Stop screaming.
I played tennis.
He lives near here.
She went to Paris to see her aunt.
How much does it cost to get to Boston?
We saw it.
I don't want to wait that long.
What's your name?
I finally beat Tom at chess.
Answer me.
What happened here?
Tom is living in Boston.
Who ate?
Tom's hurt.
I like him.
Why can't you come?
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
Add more water.
My son is taller than I am.
I don't want to go with you.
Keep it.
Where are you going on Monday?
Where are your things?
She eats nothing other than fruit.
I study abroad.
Turn down the volume, please.
Tom is very religious.
Don't wait.
Does this train stop at the Kunshan station?
We just want to talk to Tom.
Give me your phone number.
Who would believe me?
I believe in you.
What do you want to cook today?
Do you understand what he's saying?
I don't care.
She is having lunch now.
We'll sing.
Why do you want to leave today?
Would you like to eat something?
What does the word "Tatoeba" mean?
I am not your friend.
The bill could be paid today.
I was born on June 4, 1974.
Don't fight.
Times change.
Where is the bank?
You can stay here as long as you like.
Don't change sentences that are correct. You can, instead, submit natural-sounding alternative translations.
I'm not your friend.
Tom helped us win.
Tom started to scream.
I want this.
My father is in.
Tom was standing at the bar, drinking a beer.
Tom certainly isn't as smart as Mary thinks he is.
Very well. And you?
Do you want to eat now or later?
Let's see what Tom is up to.
Hold my hand.
She hasn't come yet.
Can I pay by credit card?
Nobody understands.
Come at two o'clock.
Let Tom speak.
Tom lives in a small town near Boston.
What's your phone number?
I really don't want to eat right now.
What time does the train for New York depart?
He hasn't arrived yet.
How do you write your last name?
I'll be back in five minutes.
No one laughed.
Sit down there.
I understand your language.
We often eat together.
You must go to the dentist.
Would you like to come inside?
I'm not proud of it.
Here's your mug.
I waited.
Do you have my book?
Nobody suspected anything.
We've seen them.
Just staying alive in these times is hard enough.
I like yellow.
That is my brother.
I'm counting on you.
I think Tom is doing well.
What happened in October?
I'm happy to see you again.
They eat meat.
She is eating.
Tom plays football.
Step outside.
We heard Tom was in trouble.
How old was she?
This is my wife.
I want to cook for you.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
My little brother is watching TV.
Stop Tom.
Tom certainly is good at baseball.
Is your husband at home?
It's a quarter to two.
Since Tom was speaking in French, I couldn't understand what he was saying.
Trust Tom.
Why me?
Who ran?
You can dance, can't you?
You're screaming.
My mother is active.
That's the difference between you and me.
I deserved that.
My mother tongue is Japanese.
My luggage has been stolen.
I have time.
She eats nothing other than fruit.
Don't scream.
Got it?
Come again?
Tom may not want to do that.
I'm getting off at the next station.
My mother is out.
It's quite nice.
Call Tom.
Come again.
I give you my word.
There still weren't any visible signs of spring.
She got angry.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
How far is the airport from here?
I'm not arguing.
Who came?
Tom ate.
I know Tom was a friend of yours.
They all screamed.
She is my elder sister.
Names are listed in alphabetical order.
I use it.
"I want to go home." "So do I."
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
Those who want to stay can stay.
You need friends.
Who'll drive?
The woman is eating bread.
Who has come?
I believe in you.
Tom likes potatoes.
I went inside.
Let's go to the Jacksons'.
Tom started singing a song.
Tom coughed.
He decided not to go to the party.
You are tired, aren't you?
I don't think Tom likes you.
I've got wine.
They live there.
It's a quarter past nine.
That was important.
Tom knew.
I can't stop coughing.
Turn right at the end of that street.
Where's the mistake?
My throat hurts.
Tamori was born in 1945, that is, when World War II ended.
This river flows into the Pacific Ocean.
Call the doctor!
I like reading the "La Ondo de Esperanto" magazine.
Get Tom.
He came.
There are too many things to do!
Sit at the table.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
I am your friend, right?
He told me he would go to Venice.
I couldn't keep up with Tom.
We were waiting for them.
I'm right.
She can say whatever she wants.
Kiss Tom.
That's the absolute truth.
Turn on the light, please.
This book is only available in French.
I signed the contract.
He stuck the broken pieces together.
I want to be as rich as Tom.
Who is he?
Tom is screaming.
I'm not yelling.
We're here.
Where's the Australian embassy?
The two countries negotiated a treaty.
Take us to the hospital.
It's a pineapple.
Is this enough?
Then there is a problem...
You can study here.
Tom has three sons. All of them are doctors.
It looked cheap.
You look very pale.
She's my wife.
Which tooth hurts?
Make yourself at home.
They seem American.
What is written on that signboard?
Tom slapped Mary.
Get lost!
At what time does it close?
Can you dance to this song?
Here is your bag.
I do not think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm still your friend.
Tom is inside.
You may choose whichever you want.
I know a store where you can buy that.
You'll never be alone.
This is my dog.
Pardon me?
Got it!
I don't want to argue with you.
Why wait until Monday?
They screamed.
I will gladly help you.
Eat the bread!
Tom started coughing.
What's the meaning of that?
What time does the first train leave?
Tom came.
Let's listen to what Tom has to say.
Tom was screaming.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
My name is Jack.
I don't want you.
I've seen it.
My father is frank.
I'm not very patient.
Tom started screaming.
Speak more slowly.
How are you, Mike?
Tom seemed genuinely surprised when I told him that Mary had left town.
What fun!
This is my brother.
Don't change the channel.
I'm not very busy.
Would you like something to drink?
Do you have my book?
I arrived at Narita the day before yesterday.
He knows where we live.
Don't delude yourself.
I'll pay the bill.
See you later, OK?
Would you like to come?
Try it.
I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
My stomach is full.
Come here.
I don't want it anymore.
I am your friend, right?
Tell me which you want.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
Tom reads the Washington Post every day.
What am I writing now?
I'd like a first-class ticket.
Some beaches had failed to comply with environmental regulations.
My mother plays the piano well.
Tom came.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Tom's dead.
Get up.
Tom applauded.
I'm your friend.
There was a bridge there.
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time.
I only speak French with Tom.
What for?
Fill it up.
I'm lazy.
You can eat all you want.
I feel cold.
Nobody is speaking.
Would you like to come inside?
I teach English.
There's room inside.
This is completely different.
Do you understand me?
We lost.
Do you understand what I want to say?
Close the door when you leave.
We were waiting for them.
Tom snores.
Call the doctor!
We want it.
You are doctors.
Eat whatever you want.
What is the name of this street?
This is mine.
I want to eat Chinese noodles.
I heard screaming.
Would you like to come shopping with me?
Tom doesn't want to do this.
Tom worked here.
Write your address here.
Are your hands clean?
I want to improve my Italian.
The students laughed.
I was tired.
We do what we want to do.
Do you know how to pronounce this word?
Mistakes happen.
Mike and Ken are friends.
Can you read?
Look at Tom.
They need friends.
Stop gossiping.
I'm not very busy right now.
I don't love Tom.
He lives near here.
I want to know where Tom is.
We're not yet sure what the problem is.
Who are you?
We can finish it later.
He's sleeping like a baby.
Australia is rich in natural resources.
He can speak Japanese.
Four hundred million people speak English as their first language.
They haven't done anything wrong.
I ran to my mother.
I called my good friend Tom.
Stop screaming.
How much does it cost?
We were waiting for you.
Tom's screaming.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom is teaching me French.
Tom got angry.
I need new soles on these shoes.
He was very patient.
She didn't tell me her name.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
Everything is ready.
I'll be back late.
I have a dry cough.
She smiled.
Everything's here.
Tom rushed upstairs.
I like to eat apples.
What's your phone number?
She doesn't want to talk about it.
I think Tom is Mary's older brother.
I've given up on trying to surprise you.
I'd like to change my ticket.
I think it's time you and Tom went home.
Stop that woman.
What they did was wrong.
You are always complaining.
I was humiliated in public.
I did that last year.
Nobody is speaking.
Control yourself!
What are you talking about?
Boston is a big city.
I want to be as tall as Tom.
Please sit here.
Do you understand what I mean?
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
It's seven o'clock.
He can read.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
I can't be friends with Tom.
Are you all right?
Where is the entrance to the museum?
My father is here.
Where can I catch the bus to the Tokyo station?
You know very well what Tom wants.
Where was your daughter?
He eats nothing but fruit.
See you at five.
The cement was still wet.
I'd like a shave.
He spent the evening reading a book.
Speak!
He loses his temper easily.
I drink beer.
I am not working.
I agree with you.
I'll assist you.
Tom's strange.
It's just wrong.
Call me tomorrow.
I've told you so a hundred times.
Is there a hospital nearby?
I'm wet.
Have you ever been to Boston?
Would you like to come?
I can read French, but I can't speak it.
Are you all right?
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you breathe?
Eat!
Call me.
I'm not the owner.
I'm happy to see you again.
Could you speak more slowly, please?
Speak up!
You ought to ask him for advice.
Tom died.
Stop screaming.
The museum is closed Sundays.
You can eat all you want.
Tom winked.
He stood up.
She knows where we live.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
He is a doctor.
Tom screamed loudly.
Everyone is inside Tom's trailer.
I should've followed Tom's advice.
Who would believe me?
Please reconsider.
Send it by mail.
What's your father's name?
How old is that church?
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
Tom seems to be listening carefully.
How old is he?
Tom pinched me.
People from Madrid are weird.
He tries.
Tom stopped screaming.
Tom is sick.
Show me.
She can speak Japanese.
Your shoes are here.
I've made that same mistake.
Take it.
I got up at 8 o'clock today.
Can you breathe?
I teach English.
I bought a ticket.
The accident occurred yesterday morning.
Do you have a pen on you?
I have finished.
Tom has been wounded.
Tom was shouting.
Everyone's watching.
We're inside.
We cannot sleep because of the sound.
I didn't see it.
Hello, how are you?
How long have you lived in Boston?
I've forgotten her name.
Does Tom want to see me now?
My father is busy.
Tom should've been there.
Just try to keep calm.
Why are you yelling?
Where can I buy a shirt like that?
My brother is two years older than I am.
I bought this medicine for my father.
You're not going to get away with this, Tom.
Nobody lives there.
What time do you go to bed?
Can I take a photo?
Take off your socks, please.
He hasn't come yet.
Are you doctors?
When is the breakfast served?
You are a doctor.
We're twins.
Call me tomorrow.
Tom wanted you to have this.
He only eats fruit.
Ask Tom.
Tom will never be able to keep up with us.
How long does it take from here to the station?
I am eating a cucumber.
I can't do it.
My mother does not speak English.
Stop shouting.
Here's the file.
Tom began to shout.
Why are you shouting?
What time does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Tom kicked Mary.
He will be ten next April.
Who ran?
I don't know where you want to go.
I don't want Tom to help me.
Tom doesn't want to see you.
Do you hate me?
I suddenly feel very much alone.
They all screamed.
I'm happy to see you again.
It's late.
I was lost.
Sometimes he acts quite strangely.
I saw them.
Are you all ready?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
She smiled.
Why are you screaming?!
Tom kept yelling.
Tom saw it.
Will you show me your passport, please?
Who was it?
Don't enter.
He runs.
Our native language is Japanese.
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Eat anything you like.
Mary knows nothing.
Please accept my sincere apologies.
Eat something.
That experiment was a failure.
I'm reading your book.
What have you brought?
What time do you get up?
These are birds.
This is Tom's sister.
Tom started yelling.
Give me your phone number.
I'm dancing.
You're screaming.
Tom is definitely not happy.
How old is this church?
Happy New Year!
I accepted her invitation.
Come at two o'clock.
Come in.
We're here.
I think you both know Tom.
I have finished my work.
The sooner, the better.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Whose book is that on the table?
They quarreled.
Don't move these books.
This is the wrong way!
I don't want to go there again.
Here's your key.
Where can I buy one of those?
How long has Tom been living in Boston?
Tom was inside.
Call the doctor!
She is a doctor.
Who is she?
When Tom's happy, I'm happy.
Tom learned to drive when he was eighteen.
My knee hurts.
Tom lived there.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
You've got to do something about this soon.
What do you do?
I don't understand your question.
Are tickets for the concert available here?
I took Tom's umbrella by mistake.
Show me.
She can speak French.
Everyone is tired.
Don't let it get soiled.
I will go on foot.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Don't shout.
Why are you screaming?!
I'll be back in three hours.
Go away.
We won.
We write our own songs.
She walks.
Would you like to come fishing with us?
Your parents would be proud.
I'm eating rice now.
Who's that?
French isn't difficult.
I really don't want to go.
He is eating.
What have you found?
How long have you lived in Boston?
He spent the evening reading a book.
I'll keep watch.
Tom was arrested on Monday.
Who has it?
Could you please repeat that?
Don't leave me alone.
I saw them.
Take us there.
Hello!
Don't you forget that.
I don't want to go home.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
They're doctors.
I would like you to come with me.
He got angry.
I always liked mysterious characters more.
We need to leave right now.
Tom wanted you to have this.
I'd like you to talk to Tom.
Tom was standing at the bar, having a beer.
When does the train leave for Boston?
Let there be light!
My son is studying economics.
Stop shouting.
Which floor is it on?
Goodnight!
Good evening.
How much does that cost?
Is there any mail for me?
I could not understand.
Where do you live?
How could they forget us?
I'll work alone.
I know Tom was a friend of yours.
Who are they?
Would you like to come?
I can understand your language.
Don't shout.
Leave it there.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
Tom's elderly.
Are you coming down?
What's the meaning of this word?
"What time is it now?" "It's ten o'clock."
I stayed.
Tom sat alone in his room, waiting by the phone.
We're going to stay at home today.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Tom is afraid of the dark.
They all talked.
Stand over there.
I'd like you to call me Tom.
Finish it before you go to bed.
At first, I couldn't make out what he was saying.
You deserve the prize.
I found no shoes completely to my taste.
I was able to answer the question correctly.
He was giving a speech.
How could they forget us?
They live there.
Tom is probably sleeping.
Does Tom live in Boston?
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
Turn left.
Tom shouted.
I don't want to go to school.
Try hard.
Have you got cough or cold?
I forgot.
I'm awake.
Everyone is tired.
We're going to eat now.
This is not a good sign.
We like playing soccer.
I've finished my work.
He had a bitter experience.
Who's she?
We'll scream.
Julia's native language is Italian.
I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
Call us.
Don't speak.
We can't blame anyone else.
Can I change the channel?
Who wants to go first?
Ken is a football player.
Tom dances very well.
I've seen it.
He can speak Japanese.
I live here.
Sit down!
I will catch the 9:00 train.
One of the disadvantages of living alone is that you have no one to talk to.
You should know better.
I make panna cotta without using gelatin.
I'm exhausted.
Tom wrote a song about Mary.
I will return to Australia the day after tomorrow.
Is this your book?
I need help.
Are we done?
Anyone may use this dictionary.
I don't want to go outside.
Go over there.
Some of my friends can speak French well.
What have you found?
You drive.
Tom seems to be able to sense when someone is in trouble.
I saw him wash the car.
Tom danced.
You're my daughter.
She is having lunch now.
What time is it there?
I accepted her invitation.
Tom shouldn't have left the window open.
I like math.
I'm genuinely happy for Tom.
Tom sat alone on the porch smoking a cigar.
Sit there.
Here is your key.
It's ours.
How many museums did you visit?
Tell me which you want.
Tom saw her.
The room was filled with cigarette smoke.
Tom waited outside the gate.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
Tom kept knocking on the door, but nobody came.
Tom kept knocking on the door, but nobody came.
I was negligent.
Do you have any plans right now?
I wasn't alone.
Come here!
He can say whatever he wants.
I promised.
Eat!
Tom doesn't use Facebook.
We need to get in touch with Tom's parents.
I don't want to wake Tom up.
Who wants to see me?
Tom doesn't want to see you.
I am counting on you.
You go first.
They were all happy.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
I heard you scream.
He's eating lunch now.
I saw them.
I just ate.
Tom's deaf.
Who's he?
I don't know if I still have it.
Consult a doctor.
I just eat bananas now.
Where is Boston?
Let's talk here.
What's your age?
Doesn't it work?
What'll Tom bring?
Do you live here?
I don't care what he does.
Get some sleep.
There's a mistake in the bill.
Your answer is right.
I need a minute.
Tom lied about his age to get into the club.
I am eating noodles.
Do you want to learn French?
Football is my favorite game.
I'm catching the 11:00 train.
I was very scared.
We'll dance.
Mark graduated from Harvard in 1991.
I want to deposit some money.
Wait for me. I'll be back.
How many Christmas cards did you get last year?
I can't explain it either.
Would you like to come shopping with me?
I would like to buy some cheese.
I'll come along.
Ask again later.
Are we prepared?
He eats nothing but fruit.
She walks.
Would you like to come fishing with us?
Tom and Mary were alone in the hall, talking to each other.
I saw them.
He decided not to go to the party.
She got angry.
I need friends.
I'll be back in three minutes.
Everyone screamed.
Do you have a car?
I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
Tom doesn't eat raw fish.
My shoulder hurts.
I'm not very good at this.
How much does it cost to get in?
I heard they found a skeleton buried in the basement of a house on Park Street.
Tom keeps his word.
You are always complaining.
Tom and Mary are happy together.
They have twin daughters.
They yelled.
Tom is driving.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Everybody desires happiness.
I've forgotten her name.
I'm not hungry now.
You may go there.
Drive carefully.
Everett spoke for almost two hours.
Here's the bill.
Why are you screaming?!
I'll be back in three weeks.
Your time is up.
We write our own songs.
Tom was talking.
I eat here.
Get Tom.
I've done things I'm not proud of.
I like cake.
I don't know if I have the time.
I'll be back before morning.
My father is a doctor.
Could you write that down, please?
He was giving a speech.
The experiment was successful.
He eats too much.
You look very tired.
He's eating lunch now.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
I haven't downloaded the file yet.
Tom is breathing heavily.
Grammar is very complicated.
The market is next to the pharmacy.
I am counting on you.
Those two pieces fit together.
I'm not waiting.
The glass was broken by someone.
I got it.
Tom is in the house.
Does he live near here?
He spoke.
Tom kept silent during dinner.
I didn't notice.
Goodbye!
Look at these.
How much is the entrance fee?
Can you recommend a good hotel in Boston?
Anybody will do.
You called?
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
What have you brought?
Is my laundry ready?
How old is the universe?
Keep an eye on Tom.
Can you please repeat what you just said?
I like maths.
Stop here.
Why are you shouting?
Where can I get stamps?
We've found Tom.
Go home.
Whose is this?
Wonderful!
I'm not Tom.
You look sick.
Children love doing this.
The ambassador has returned.
I eat meat.
Would you like to come out and play?
I am not thirsty.
No one man could do it.
That's because you're a girl.
I fell in love with him.
That's a bad sign.
Nice to see you again.
What's up?
Tom is staying with his relatives.
Let me in.
Do you eat meat?
Mary is huddled on the couch.
Everybody's ready to go.
We don't care what he does.
How old is your father?
It doesn't surprise me.
Give me a couple of minutes alone with Tom.
Is this your car?
They're doctors.

Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
I am fine.
Are you sure?
I am working.
Do you know what he said?
I am your friend.
At seven I'll be back.
Tom coughed all night.
Tom wanted you to have this.
Go over there.
The door is open.
How deep?
Tom tried to hit Mary.
She can speak Japanese.
He speaks French.
Tom went outside.
Tom changed his name.
This is the only alternative.
They won.
I fell in love with him.
Don't eat!
Look there.
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
You cannot lift the piano alone.
I was surprised.
He was elected mayor again.
I found his house easily.
She's younger than me.
They seem American.
Tom makes great burgers.
How old was he?
I hit Tom.
Eat something.
This theory is very controversial.
Watch Tom.
Everyone agrees.
Follow Tom.
Go slow.
I'm not proud of this.
You need a new girlfriend.
You are tired, aren't you?
I don't want to go near Tom.
Pardon me, I couldn't get it.
We played football together.
Where is the bus terminal?
Let's see what can be done.
What's your home address?
What is the total number of students?
I don't feel like eating anything now.
They yelled.
You work too much.
That is my sister.
Tom is going to be executed in three days.
Tom will return tomorrow.
Tom is learning programming.
Let me speak.
I am looking for a good hotel.
We will be at home today.
I don't want to go with you.
What Tom did was dangerous.
What did you say?
What are you going to be when you grow up?
He coughed.
This is his house.
I've never told this to anyone.
Tom is a very tall boy.
How much does this cost?
Say it.
You are very brave.
Everyone looked unhappy.
Go slow.
Come here!
I didn't scream.
Who ate?
What does that word mean?
Is there another way to get there?
I can manage it.
You're in no position to make any demands.
You called?
You're so impatient with me.
How long will you stay here?
My right shoulder hurts.
No, I don't want to go.
He came.
He has three daughters.
How long do you study French every day?
Tom shook his head.
Please correct my pronunciation.
Bill can ride a bicycle.
Is he American?
Everything is negotiable.
She's eating fruit.
I'm going to Hokkaido.
Don't stop.
He taught me how to write.
It is a matter of taste.
I feel well.
This is driving me crazy.
I don't want to get involved in that sort of thing.
Answer me.
My mother can play golf very well.
She got angry.
Three were injured.
Is it a recent picture?
I can read.
If the world weren't in the shape it is now, I could trust anyone.
What is your name?
Tom's injured.
The war ended in 1954.
Sit down there.
They eat healthy foods.
We wanted to talk about Tom.
I can't attend the meeting.
I know my daughter.
I'm not your friend.
He eats too much.
Come outside.
We're not Bengali.
Forget about Tom.
Tom's sick.
She's a good person.
Walk more slowly.
Where can I claim my luggage?
Stop the car here.
I'm sick!
How tall are you?
I got your address from Tom.
You didn't understand.
Thirteen people were killed.
I need time.
You were Tom's only friend.
I'll walk.
I'll never tell anybody.
We have to move very quickly.
You are rich.
Show me.
Close the door when you leave.
She eats fruit.
That won't happen.
I don't agree with him.
Keep Tom inside.
Beware of pickpockets.
Who wants to go?
I'm going to take a bath.
They all screamed.
I'm quite tired.
Who's speaking?
The church bell is ringing.
Horses eat grass.
What is your name?
Come and see for yourself.
This is her house.
I like apples.
Don't worry about me.
Get Tom.
Stop shouting.
Somebody came.
She is eating.
Help us.
Consult your doctor.
Tom started yelling.
I am not your friend.
Will you fill out this form, please?
I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
Sit right there.
To me, it's important.
I'm coming back.
I'm not your friend.
What else?
Wash before first wearing.
I'm not proud.
Tom has been found.
Someone screamed.
Are you a doctor?
Go.
Tom helped.
I'm your friend.
What do you usually do on Sundays?
Tom was crying.
Tom saw it.
You ought to ask him for advice.
Everyone's here.
My father is here.
You should sleep.
Please speak slowly.
Stop yelling.
I have lost my keys.
What for?
What is his age?
I have lost my key.
Tom wants me.
Turn right at the crossroad.
I saw him.
He's a doctor.
The meeting was held here.
He hasn't arrived yet.
My native language is Japanese.
What did you forget?
Can you get a day off?
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
Who is your teacher?
Who's he?
Tom has been crying.
What?
It's three o'clock.
Tom doesn't have any proof.
How did you come to know her?
I could have died.
Tom saw you.
How tall are you?
I wanted this.
He runs.
I don't go to work on Sundays.
Tom works very hard, but not as hard as Mary.
I just wanted to check my email.
I can't find my luggage.
Tom wanted advice from Mary.
Everybody laughed.
I want time.
"She likes music." "So do I."
She was raised in France.
The road was very bumpy.
Where can I buy envelopes?
Tom tried to keep his chin up.
Give Tom a kiss.
What time's your plane?
I saw Tom last night.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Salt is used to thaw ice.
They're children.
I can beat you.
Hit Tom.
I bought a pair of shoes.
It can't be!
English is not my mother tongue.
Stop screaming.
We'll win.
You don't understand.
I'm 19.
They yelled.
Is there a McDonald's near here?
You called?
Tom is good at cooking.
It's very hot inside.
I'm yours.
I work in Milan.
Nobody laughed.
What does your son do?
Everyone knows it now.
Bring it closer.
Can I walk there?
I am starting this evening.
Tom has a blue car.
Tom kept an eye on the children.
Stand up.
I don't agree with him.
My mother loves music.
Sit here.
Let Tom speak.
I'm just looking, thank you.
I received your letter.
Stop right here.
I have already changed my clothes.
Listen.
I am very tired.
Tom usually goes to bed at ten-forty.
What time do you usually eat lunch?
She can speak Japanese.
Tom is yelling.
Tom saw dirty footprints on the white carpet.
I don't want to go to Italy.
Turn right.
Are those yours?
I went, too.
We're shy.
I'd like to change my reservation.
Read this first.
Maybe it'll snow.
I'm optimistic.
Tom kept his eyes closed.
I am not feeling too well.
Would you please repeat what you just said?
She didn't tell me her name.
Tom doesn't want to hurt us.
You're not paying attention.
Let's drink coffee while we talk.
Could you show Tom around?
Would you like some more?
These are Tom's.
Go inside.
How should I know?
It's still mine.
You can eat anything you want.
She got sick this weekend.
Tom broke my nose.
Tom was crying last night.
May I see your passport?
Start now.
I'd like to see my son.
What is the distance from here to the station?
I like maths.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
He looks pale.
Where is the boarding gate for UA 111?
Go away.
Tom keeps his word.
You are rich.
Who wrote the letter?
What's your full name?
You're going to have to come with us, Tom.
What do you want?
Do you have a bigger bowl?
They all screamed.
Do you know what he said?
Do you understand what he's saying?
Tom looked around carefully.
Don't eat!
We're both named Tom.
Did you get Tom's message?
Tom doesn't know Mary is here.
Where's the bank?
Do you understand French?
He's kicking me!
You can eat all you want.
You go first.
Three people were killed.
People should understand that the world is changing.
What actually happened?
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Why are you yelling?
I'm not cooking.
She's my wife.
What are my orders?
You can wait here.
School starts next week.
May I swim in this lake?
What's your age?
I finally got across the river.
Does he live near here?
Before going to France, Mr. Suzuki studied French.
What has happened?
You're not the first person to tell me that.
I'll certainly come tomorrow.
Isn't Tom great?
Tom recovered.
I don't want you to go.
Tom seldom eats at home.
Stop that woman.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
Who are those guys?
Tom is currently unemployed.
Tom has come to pick up his children.
Tom was born in October.
Don't talk!
I never listen to Tom anyway.
Good morning!
Tom's strong.
He has two daughters.
Did you speak?
He is a doctor.
You'll have to wait at least an hour to get a ticket.
I would like an air-conditioned room.
Tom ate breakfast alone.
Tom now knows everything.
This is her house.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I'll scream.
Don't look.
I am your friend.
Was Tom there?
I don't know the answer.
May I take salt?
I believe Tom is doing well.
You can stay as long as you like.
How many museums did you visit?
Who cut the cake?
How much does that cost?
Which tooth hurts?
Is it far from here?
I don't feel like eating now.
I have two nieces.
I'll be back by six.
Tom lives around here somewhere.
We're trapped.
Are you sure the person you saw was Tom?
I have a headache.
Tom listened.
That is mine.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
They don't care.
She's younger than me.
Tom cried.
He did not work on Sunday night.
What's the purpose of your visit?
Run!
This is not important.
You didn't understand.
Of course!
You can eat whatever you like.
We do what we want.
Hit Tom.
I know.
How do you keep so calm?
Tom started yelling.
Can you come to my country?
Nobody understands me.
Good-bye!
I had to show Tom something.
Tom hesitated.
What've you found?
Children like cake.
This river is deepest here.
Where are your things?
What do you want to be?
Bring mangos.
How old is that church?
I need to buy some medicine for my father.
Can I ask you some questions?
What's your name, please?
I arrived at the station ten minutes late.
I'll buy it.
This tape recorder will make it easier for us to learn English.
What's Tom trying to do?
I have two daughters.
Where is the elevator?
Tom thinks you're stupid.
She is a doctor.
Don't ask.
That's what I was looking for.
Take my handkerchief.
It's absolutely impossible.
Start now.
Don't worry about me.
She got angry.
I'm pregnant.
I'm not your teacher.
I have a daughter.
He is an experienced teacher.
Why do you want to leave today?
Tom doesn't want to be here.
Do you want to learn French?
Stop there.
He lives near here.
She eats fruit.
I couldn't stop myself.
She is having lunch now.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom is teaching me French.
How far is it to the airport?
Do you understand?
You don't understand.
Rome is in Italy.
Please look after my luggage.
Tom sat on the stairs.
I think Tom said his last name is Jackson.
God exists.
It's already seven o'clock.
You may go there.
I didn't want this to happen.
We're different.
She has two children.
Am I going in the right direction?
Everybody's ready to go.
How much money would you like to withdraw?
The pen is broken.
This is my bag.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not proud of that.
You may use my new car.
Who are those guys?
I'll stand.
Who is he?
They're inside.
Don't fight.
I am a doctor.
She is a doctor.
Would you like to dance?
Here is your key.
What time does the train arrive at Yokohama?
What a nerve!
Who broke the vase?
Tom works here.
Tom and Mary want to see us.
They have two daughters.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
Last night I arrived late.
He is a doctor.
I'm eating here.
Have you got cough or cold?
Tom's alive.
Lincoln died in 1865.
How are you, Mike?
Is Tom home?
Tom saw you.
Someday I'll run like the wind.
You ought to ask him for advice.
My father is very good at fishing.
What was the last station?
You're not going to get away with it.
How long do you want it for?
How much did you eat?
How long does it take to get to the station?
Tom is there.
It is ten minutes before eleven.
Come with me.
He can speak French.
Tom has been hurt.
I screamed.
Is your watch correct?
My father is tall.
Tom began screaming.
Stop!
Everybody paid.
Tom was shouting.
Please hurry.
Everyone was screaming.
Pull over here.
Tom screamed again.
I didn't hit anybody.
Eat whatever you like.
Hold the candle.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
Please bring us two cups of tea and one cup of coffee.
I don't want to go alone.
Who wants tea?
Help Tom.
I saw him wash the car.
He can read.
Do you have a pen on you?
What do you want to be?
She can say whatever she wants.
Who sent you?
How did you come to know her?
It looked fresh.
Keep it.
You must take this cough syrup.
Goodbye.
Don't enter.
When I got home, I found I had lost my wallet.
Hurry up, Tom.
I trust you.
Will you look after my baggage?
A lot of people attended Tom's funeral.
Tom has left me.
You are rich.
Thank you very much, doctor.
Is there a discount for children?
Tom is speaking.
Where can I buy tickets?
You may go home now.
They all screamed.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Tell me what you want.
I'm genuinely happy for Tom.
He taught me how to write.
Does the room have air conditioning?
I have an older brother.
I like tea.
Tom almost forgot about the meeting.
I don't understand German.
All three have resigned.
I live in a small village.
Don't delude yourself.
She is my older sister.
Are we prepared?
This old house is haunted.
You didn't understand.
My father is here.
Thanks!
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Did you get Tom's message?
Has anybody left me any message?
Is anybody there?
I've made that same mistake several times.
Everyone is here.
I don't want to go there.
He runs.
Are you all right?
I totally agree.
Your answer is wrong.
Me, too.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
I never liked biology.
Did you read it all?
There's no way I'm going to leave you alone here.
I don't know exactly.
The police warned us to keep back.
Tom won't win.
Tom kept crying all night.
Who fell?
Ask again later.
Obviously, Tom hasn't told anyone about what happened.
Sit here.
You go first.
She can speak French.
They have twin daughters.
It was dark under the bridge.
Do you want to eat noodles or rice?
I don't want to go with you.
Tom and Mary both are artists.
Eat whatever food you like.
They are doctors.
I'm able to swim.
How much are these potatoes?
Can I try it on?
I'd like to withdraw some money.
Is it here?
Nothing remained in the refrigerator.
Tom knows me very well.
There's so much I want to say to you.
I don't know where you want to go.
They haven't done anything wrong.
I've met Tom several times.
She can speak French.
I am just kidding.
I don't understand what you are saying.
Could you speak a little louder please?
What they did was wrong.
Do you accept credit cards?
Nicole can speak Japanese very well.
That was an evil bunny.
I didn't want to do that.
We play football every Saturday.
Nothing's there.
Is there a hospital near here?
How old are you?
I was there.
Come again.
He's eating.
I'm counting on you.
I'm not thirsty.
"Anything else?" "No, that's all."
Tom ate.
What is going on?
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Come quick!
Where is the boarding gate for Japan Airlines 124?
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
He tries.
I want it.
Wait outside.
I had a cat.
Susan was terrified.
I give you my word.
I heard screams.
Stop!
Calm down.
They wanted to steal the car.
She accompanied me to the hospital.
I know what I want. I just haven't found it yet.
It's been raining since last night.
He went to the dentist.
Eat the bread!
I'll take him.
I eat bread.
You are not eating anything.
You are rich.
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time.
You are my daughter.
I guess you don't need my help.
Hold your tongue!
I hear footsteps outside.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
How tall you are!
Don't move!
Tom lives here.
Niue is a country.
Sit down!
I don't deny this.
Don't look.
Tom isn't here yet.
I'm not proud of what I did.
I'm not your friend.
He went to the dentist.
Mary arrived at the hospital.
Could you please speak a little slower?
I'm staying at the Sheraton Hotel.
Aren't you a doctor?
Do I have to change trains?
Tom and Mary are screaming.
It is unfortunately true.
Is anybody home?
Tom likes reading books.
I'm right.
It looks like I'm going to arrive late.
I shouldn't have logged off.
Wash before first wearing.
Tom wants to speak with you.
Sit down!
Where can I buy a ticket?
Tom should've won.
Mary ran.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
Cut your nails.
Could you call again later, please?
The baby is screaming.
Where's the ticket counter?
I'm not denying that.
Let go of me.
Do you have a vacancy?
You are in my way.
When did you begin studying English?
Today is a national holiday.
Follow Tom.
Sit down.
Forgive Tom.
I'll be back by midnight.
What time does your plane depart?
I have not forgotten.
Everybody wants recognition.
Tom's wounded.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Those are too big.
I've returned.
Tom insulted Mary.
I'm bad at sports.
Is the museum open today?
I'd like to change my reservation from three to five nights.
Why are you screaming?!
Now fix that.
There's one cup on the table.
Tom is still in Boston.
Tom likes to be busy and hates sitting around doing nothing.
I like tea.
I like eating cake.
I'll eat anything.
Who's screaming?
I like cake.
I want you to stay with Tom.
I do not understand.
Tom tries.
Wait here till I come back.
Very well. And you?
They screamed.
One problem still remains.
My father is going to China.
I'm exhausted.
She hasn't come yet.
Who won?
I only speak a little French.
We sat there.
What time does the next train leave?
How old are you?
She doesn't want to talk about it.
What does the word "Tatoeba" mean?
That's Tom.
I've told you so a hundred times.
Control yourself!
I want some money.
Don't hurt me.
I can't believe it!
No way!
Tom wants to eat lunch now.
I'm well.
They're inside.
Do you know a good dentist?
How do you expect me to do all this alone?
Tom's yelling.
Go home.
Stay right there.
It is raining.
Try it.
I'll be back in four or five days.
Don't leave me alone.
"I'll be back," said Tom.
That man is Tom.
Get lost!
Tom can't read all these books in one day.
Tom kept interrupting me.
Your bicycle is similar to mine.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Everyone gossips.
Look! There is a cat in the kitchen.
Eat whatever you like.
Here is your bag.
Why are you yelling?
He spent the evening reading a book.
I want to know who started it.
Where can I buy that magazine?
I want an MP3 player!
I'd like a receipt, please.
She can say whatever she wants.
My father is very nice.
How do you pronounce this word?
Could I have the check?
France is in Western Europe.
You can eat all you want.
I'm only joking.
I don't agree with him.
Is everything okay?
Leave us.
Here's your key.
Buddhism originated in India.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
He was speaking.
He can read.
Rabbits like to eat carrots.
Everyone knows it now.
French is not an easy language.
The responsibility is mine.
Close that door.
I don't want you to go.
I haven't slept.
He stood up.
Don't talk!
What is the charge for extra luggage?
Go to the hospital.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Don't go.
Tom is not happy about this.
Ask me again in October.
Tom saw it.
Let's try to make Tom laugh.
I'm not very good at swimming.
I have a cold.
I am cold.
Sit there.
What is the next stop?
Do come again.
Tom left me.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I don't want to eat anything right now.
I'm lazy.
You are very brave.
It was entirely Tom's fault.
Tom started screaming.
Look at these.
Yes.
There is a hospital nearby.
I'd like to open an account.
Tom lies.
Like mother, like daughter.
I'm getting off at the next stop.
I eat pasta.
Tom worked there.
I don't speak Bengali.
Everyone dies.
I was in Rome.
I yelled.
I have two nephews.
I'm not jealous.
Got it?
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
We didn't do it.
He can speak French.
You should sleep.
The baby is screaming.
My stomach hurts.
What is the price?
I missed my stop. How long does it take to reach the next stop?
Are you sick?
Have you ever done that?
I'd like to change my room.
It's a question of personal taste.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
I'm checking out.
I have been to Rome.
I have to go to sleep.
Do you understand French?
What time does the next train leave for Tokyo?
Who is your teacher?
He's eating.
I made it myself.
Thank you!
He has trouble remembering names.
I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
That bag is mine.
Sit down.
The village I live in is very small.
What will you eat?
Time is up.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Is he a doctor?
I was scared half to death.
Are you sisters?
Times have changed.
They eat healthy foods.
Get some sleep.
We are lost.
Tom still lives at home.
Summer has ended.
Where's the museum?
I'll be back later.
Tom followed Mary out of the house.
Tom's right.
How much will it be?
How old is Tony?
It has happened at least three times.
I have two nephews.
Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
Tom seems happy and excited.
Everyone was satisfied.
Do you have any cough medicine?
She got angry.
Your mother died yesterday.
Tom kept his eyes closed.
He is having lunch now.
What is the best way to get there?
"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
Who has come?
I take vitamins.
Tom tried to keep his chin up.
I can read French.
It's quite good.
Finish it before you go to bed.
What would you like to eat?
I just want Tom to get well.
Say it.
Close that door.
Your bike is better than mine.
I'm back.
I found the book easy.
Tom wept.
My father is at home.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I couldn't stop.
They all talked.
Do I need to book a seat?
Then what?
Everybody is here.
She got sick this weekend.
Speak clearly.
Find Tom.
How old was he?
Where's Tom gone?
I heard you screaming.
I don't want to argue with you.
How long does it take to the train station by taxi?
I'll be outside.
This is my younger sister.
I saw him running.
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
We talked about various topics.
Let's wait here.
Call me.
I went aboard.
I am south of the north.
Stop that woman.
I'll be back at 2:30.
Where's the nearest hospital?
You don't understand.
What do you want to cook today?
She got mad.
Have you finished it?
I am coughing.
Everybody's here.
What does this word mean?
I will be late.
It may snow in the evening.
I want to buy a pineapple.
I'm nervous now.
It's too low.
Leave us.
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are the twelve months of the year.
What languages are spoken in America?
Here's my phone number.
Tom is 100% correct.
Who ate?
Monique and I can't stop laughing.
I'm not very good at this.
He told me he would go to Venice.
You're doctors.
That book is written in French.
Have fun.
I didn't forget.
I don't want to eat now.
People were angry.
This is Tom's sister.
I'm not at all tired.
I'm talking.
Tom's coming.
Terrific!
You go first.
My name is Emily.
He spoke.
They all talked.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
Tom was outside.
I have won.
I have a tattoo on my left shoulder.
Tom has time.
What do you want to cook today?
How did this get started?
Be quiet.
This hotel was built last year.
Have I arrived too late?
Any child can do that.
How old is Tom?
I eat pears.
What team does Tom play for?
Stay there.
Tom kept knocking on the door, but nobody came.
Tom hardly ever keeps his word.
I'll be back to get you in 20 minutes.
This project will take at least a year to finish.
I left the door open.
Finish this as soon as possible.
I decided to call Tom.
I am not your friend.
Control yourself.
What color is your house?
Stop shouting.
Your time is up.
I'm eating bread.
