It happened yesterday.
Someone's singing.
It doesn't surprise me.
You'll find a way.
Tom told us to stop talking.
Would you be careful with that?
There's a difference.
I'm just a friend.
Tom is the one I deal with.
I'm not an invalid.
I've been tricked.
Why did you fire us?
We care about their safety.
I don't think we can trust Tom.
I made it work.
It was a nightmare.
I like this perfume.
Tom's eyes are blue.
It looks like I drank too much yesterday. My head is pounding. I'm completely hungover.
Dan made it back to London.
Should I go?
The bicycle is mine.
Tom outsmarted me.
This tooth is an incisor.
This is incredible.
Nothing has to happen.
Tom is quite drunk.
I haven't been shopping yet.
Tom and I were married to each other for three years.
Whose beer is this?
It wasn't helping.
When did you go to Boston?
Tom filled out the application for me.
The girl came into the room and burst into tears.
Dan had sex change surgery.
It's a bit awkward.
I'm engaged.
I study psychology.
No one's going to find him.
I think I'll be able to stand that.
Don't make me come after you, Tom.
You should feel flattered.
I'm not calling her.
About how many books do you own?
I should've gone home earlier.
It's a no-brainer.
Tom lay on his back.
I'll always love you.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
The TV won't turn on.
You can answer me whenever you like.
Mary is wearing a white dress today.
You'll never guess.
Very well, we'll make allowance in your case.
What do you think Tom will want to eat?
I feel as though I've committed rape, although I know that that makes no sense.
That's being done.
Are you a bachelor?
You're on a roll.
As things now stand, I'll have to quit my job.
Where are my parents?
Even Tom knows that.
Tom is a fast walker.
You need help.
Are you going to help them?
A hunter hunted hares with his dog.
We shouldn't be here.
We aren't in danger, are we?
I'm joking.
That's no way to talk about Tom.
Why wasn't I asked?
It looks really expensive.
If we leave now, we should make it.
Tom misses his wife.
I look forward to seeing you.
Tom ignored the question.
We take oil for granted.
Don't do that to me.
We have only three left.
We have no secrets.
Where did you get it?
Thanks for your contribution.
We could use a hand.
I think you've been drinking too much.
I hope you can help Tom.
I can walk to work from here.
Tom hasn't eaten yet.
My car's over there.
Do you think three hours will be enough?
Why would I help her?
What's that?
The man is young.
Don't lose heart now.
Mark's book is very interesting.
What would Tom think?
Magnesium is a chemical element.
We like Tom.
This medicine will help you.
Do you want to go to the mall with us?
I had to see Jacques.
Tom put on one of John's shirts.
I'll meet with Tom.
Isn't that theirs?
He has a butler and a cook.
I've always found Tinker Bell very sexy.
He has a few friends.
I'm getting a little drunk.
Are they even really friends?
It was required.
I often don't have time to eat breakfast.
He banged the door in anger.
We miss you.
We should get together sometime.
Mary's a real expert.
Here's what's going to happen.
Tom says I have to babysit tonight.
The head of our department is a man named Tom Jackson.
He is about my size.
Get out of my seat.
Don't go down there.
She aspired to become an actress.
Tom was sent here to take over.
Tom became anxious.
We chose this one.
Our water pipes burst.
You're absolutely right.
Is Tom still asleep?
Ask them to explain it.
Tom may not have to give up anything.
He's a newcomer.
That was a fun surprise.
Tom sipped his drink.
Dan is a friend from school.
I should know by now not to ask Tom for help.
Do you know what that was?
Tom asked us to be quiet.
Tom is being tortured.
Leave town.
We're going back for them.
They're part of us.
I thought you hated him.
Do you think we should give up?
Tom is a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Tom had to wait.
I don't know if there's time.
There are some apples in that box.
Are you dressed?
That's a huge relief.
Where did you see Tom?
It was a bitter pill to swallow.
The sun is just a star amongst zillions of others.
Is that your daily routine now?
Even if you stop me, I won't change my mind.
You're inefficient.
Is this your family?
I have the best and most honourable intentions.
Did Tom ask you out?
Only the best is good enough.
I have to go even if it rains cats and dogs.
"There's a hair in my soup." "It looks like your hair."
What good are they?
It's not like Tom to be late.
I'm in need of affection.
I'm giving you one last chance.
I couldn't afford to get you a new drum.
Tom's eyes are open.
Tom is at the general assembly.
Be on time.
That's why I'm going.
Tom is angry with me.
I'm pretty zonked.
Come on.
The girl let the bird loose.
Tom and Mary sat together on the bench.
We should ask Tom.
The heat is intense.
Can you tell me about her?
Bumblebees are bigger than bees.
Who started this rumor?
We have all we need for now.
Who are you there with?
I am climbing a palm tree.
Tom remained calm.
He was sound asleep.
I like your pair of eyeglasses.
She chops wood every day.
Tom started to choke.
I wasn't fast enough.
I live on the top floor of a six storey apartment block.
I can feel my heart pounding.
Tom seems to know what he wants.
Can you deliver it?
How're you doing, Tom?
I've got something for them.
They'll announce the winner tomorrow.
The barber cut his hair.
You forgot your backpack!
I'm going to help you now.
They're the same age.
I was expecting them.
Thanks for inviting me.
Bears are very dangerous.
Say the alphabet backwards.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I didn't do it for us.
Things were better then than now.
I thought Tom was sick.
Sometimes we get lost.
Thinking is one thing, doing is another.
Tell me how it went.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom asked me whether I liked his plan or not.
Tom is here with me.
Tom was very relaxed.
Hero worship is a dangerous thing.
Tom paid a $300 fine.
These are my boys.
They saw the boy carried away to the hospital.
My dog really likes oranges.
We're still in the dark as to the identity of the killer.
Nothing could be done about that.
They'll be very happy together.
What was the matter?
I'm really going to miss you.
We meet at last, Tom.
He is on the team.
Get Tom on the phone.
You pay me very well.
I'll manage.
We can rely on Tom.
I don't think you realize what you're suggesting.
Any of you can do it.
Tom is quite wealthy.
I can't come with you today.
Time is not an absolute reality but an aspect of our consciousness.
It's hers.
That was ideal.
You look Japanese.
I didn't want anyone to go hungry.
They pretend to pay and we pretend to work.
How do you know about them?
The telephone rang.
Tom vomited blood.
Tom told me he wasn't going to be at school tomorrow.
My youngest brother has two children from his first marriage, and another child from his second.
I need to feed her.
That was really mean.
By the way, Mike, please tell me how to get to your house.
You can't use this.
You're not helping.
Do you need some help?
We want to help you.
I'm not disagreeing.
Tom seems to be calm.
How long have you been studying medicine?
Tom turned around and looked at Mary.
I got up, I washed, I drank a cup of coffee and I left.
Why would Tom do it?
This pair of trousers is just right for me.
Tom raised his hands.
Tom isn't used to driving on the left side of the road.
I'll go and get her.
He keeps giving me cheesy compliments, although I've made it clear that I'm not interested in him.
It's perfectly useless.
It's been too long.
We need it.
That article was written in English.
I won't betray you.
I don't know if I should believe Tom or not.
She practiced her English pronunciation yesterday.
We've been robbed.
Move your ass!
I got him to do it.
He walked along the shore.
Let's go back to Tom.
I'm not going to allow Tom to go to Mary's party.
It disappointed Tom.
I just got a message from them.
I'm pretty sure Tom was trying to tell us something.
Were you there when Tom told Mary he was going to Boston?
Who wrote this book?
I know it must be hard to believe.
Tom's up.
The city was destroyed in the war.
I should've quit earlier.
They'll probably come by car.
You're hurting them.
Tom smashed a champagne glass against the wall.
She told us the road was closed.
I can't hear her.
Don't talk that way.
How much is the kilo of leek?
The doctor came in carrying a black bag.
Maybe Tom didn't use the right kind of bait.
Just get me the list.
The window was open.
Someone gave her a car.
The chicken is pecking at Tom.
You have no idea how to do this, do you?
It may be your only hope.
I want to live.
Tom had the gall to ignore my advice.
You did that already.
The train is running thirty minutes late.
Tom turned on the heat.
Tom is smarter than any other student in our class.
How did you know I wanted to speak to Tom?
Often, that old man plays with puppets. It's creepy.
I give you my word.
I'm kind of tired.
She is growing tall.
Do we have insurance?
I'll tell Tom you're ready.
You've got 24 hours.
I'd do anything to help him.
You don't remember?
I'm clumsy.
We're just nervous.
I didn't know you wanted to learn how to swim.
That was hilarious.
We have enough water.
We have a pool.
You can't save me.
Does he have a stomach ache?
I'm not letting you go by yourself.
I'm extremely hungry.
Who could blame us?
How much is this sofa?
Why don't you give your wife a little thanks?
I need a nap.
It's too difficult to explain.
Give me back my book.
Don't leave me alone.
Tom looks frightened.
Tom isn't sure he wants to get involved.
Tom is extraordinary.
I think we should let Tom go to Boston by himself.
Why don't you be quiet and listen?
You were so happy.
He is blind as a mole.
Tom and Mary have never met.
Was his name Tom or John?
I've decided to forgive him.
The cashier will give you the discount.
Am I approved?
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I need fish.
It may take a while.
He works very hard.
Just give it a little time.
Were there any problems?
We'd better go help them.
We are in a phase of dramatic change.
Tom sat on the curb.
You want to buy books.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish this tomorrow.
A cute little turtle was found on the beach.
That's Tom's watch.
It's the first time in my life I've felt so connected with someone.
Tom sat at his desk.
Tom raised his arms.
I told Tom to stop.
I haven't lied to you.
How far is it to Boston?
I went to the market.
Tom made a serious error.
That medicine worked.
I'm glad Tom's OK.
I just cut my finger.
We should help her.
A child is missing.
Dan is Linda's new husband.
You know, I don't want to kill you.
That pole is not quite vertical.
You're embarrassing me.
Tom never really wanted to learn how to swim.
I thought I'd buy one of these for Tom.
I was right about you.
I got married again.
Tom and Mary are planning to come next year.
We've got to stay focused.
Tom stayed seated.
How do I get one of those?
I'm waiting for them to return.
Tom felt humiliated.
I know how important Tom is to you.
Did you get this from them?
I've seen how badly Tom dances.
It's sort of strange.
You guys are lucky.
It's not yet working.
Tom put the thermometer in his mouth.
It is impossible to live without water and without oxygen.
What is it with you and him?
I don't know the title of this song ... what is it?
Tom looks indecisive.
Forget him.
Tom looked very sick.
He is considered to be a highly qualified employee.
Let's start tonight.
Mary placed her purse on the table.
Did you deliver the note to Tom?
He visited a friend.
This is where Tom said he used to live.
The problem is all parents wants their children to go to Harvard.
Watch out! There's a big hole there.
We'll never ever forget them.
Emily wrote the sentence.
I'll be waiting right outside.
That's what I want.
Please let me do it.
Tom went to the park by himself.
Was it fun?
Calm down. What's the problem?
Here's your paycheck.
It's our duty.
They didn't like any of my suggestions.
He came back many years later.
It is almost three.
I gave them a chance.
Tom shares a room with his older brother.
We aren't married.
Nothing in nature is useless.
The wheel began to turn.
It seems that everything works.
Mary wore a flowered dress.
Let Tom do that for you.
My speakers are kid toys compared to yours.
Tom nearly lost his nerve.
Please correct my pronunciation.
We've all seen it.
Who threw the bottle?
I wish I could be there with you now.
I'll be in the attic.
We aren't very busy yet.
Please speak slower.
We're happy that Tom arrived home safely.
I just know I wouldn't have missed Tom.
Do you have your stuff with you?
I believe you've been looking for me.
I'll see to that personally.
Always keep this dictionary handy.
Let's check with Tom.
I'll get them to help you.
Let me show you where to put that.
Are you her pimp?
What do you call it?
If I need money, I'll ask my father.
The child has advanced in his knowledge.
Teachers must understand children.
Did you try to review the English lessons?
Tom is very nervous.
I know the world's gone to pieces.
Tom has blond hair and green eyes.
I'll keep on trying.
Tom reacted appropriately.
25 times 6 equals 1_0. What is the missing digit?
Please let me carry your bag.
I'll be right by your side.
My hands are sticky.
I've got proof right here.
Tom isn't going to let that happen.
Tom bought a coat.
It's better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and prove it.
Everyone has a wish of some kind.
I'll do anything for you.
I'm not your slave!
One of your boobs fell down.
You've gotten fat.
He made an apology.
He has overcome many obstacles.
It's just something I have to live with.
How did you spend your holiday?
There's room for one more in my car.
Why do you want this job?
I washed the sheets.
Is Tom still hungry?
I'd better go look for him.
One moment, please. I'll be right back.
He is good at tennis.
They headed westward.
Did you really go there?
You're entitled to a lunch break.
Tom attempted to calm Mary down.
I have you to thank.
Would you like to go to a movie tonight?
Tom is kind of shy.
Tom is still reading.
I'm sorry I was so rude to your sister.
Your sighs are in vain - I will not fulfil your fantasy.
Tom seems unusual.
I completely forgot about them.
Hey. That's not fair.
It must be a warning.
Is everyone hungry?
Her heart was beating wildly.
He entered the army.
I'll meet Tom at the usual place.
That's my business.
They're not standing.
Allow me to explain.
I saw him but once.
Don't even touch it.
Tom had a bright idea.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
Where can I put my bags?
Let me show you a better way to do that.
Tom is visiting Boston.
This isn't a party.
I designed it myself.
Tom's house is full of toys.
I speak French, too.
Please forget I said that.
I have a weak bladder.
Is your mother here?
My parents said it's bad luck to walk on your knees.
Do you see the connection?
The boy came back.
Why would Tom worry?
Tom painted the window sills white.
We believe him.
Hey, did you see that?
I read lips.
Is Tom your nephew?
It's already taken care of.
Tom never seems to pay much attention in class.
The event affected his future.
I can only see what you see.
Tom kept a pet python in his apartment.
Soft wool is more expensive than coarse wool and both are superior to synthetics made of nylon.
You need to be a team player.
Tom sat across the table from Mary.
Thank you for making it so easy.
I have drunk the wine.
Do we have to help him?
Go on ahead.
I don't like riding the subway.
I have a lot of land.
You're safe in here.
Tom signed the check.
I want a new knife.
I know exactly what I'd want to do if I were Tom.
You've already thanked me.
You did a good thing.
Competitiveness is neither good nor bad in itself.
I felt bad.
Maybe I can give you one.
Revenge is sweet.
The people I work with are all very kind.
Tom refused to admit that what he'd done was wrong.
Isn't that beautiful?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
This isn't possible.
It was really sweet.
I don't understand science.
She met her uncle.
I'd like to have a glass of water.
We're not friends.

If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some.
I can get us out of here.
Don't make a mess.

Birds have wings.
It's not worth it.
A fool with a tool is still a fool.
Where's my sister?
The police can't arrest Tom.
I'm getting dressed.
Tom has had an accident at work.
Do you think it's possible to pass all the exams?
Don't try to set the rules for everybody here. You're just a member of the group, not a leader.
She is a young university student.
What did you make?
I thought Tom wouldn't like Mary.
Tom stepped on my foot.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Can I use your pen?
I never thought I'd find them.
Hey, that smells good.
Why is this happening to me?
Were they serious?
Are you still around?
Can I have the list?
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Why didn't you listen to your mother?
It isn't what I thought.
The question is perhaps too complex for you.
He drives his own car.
Physics is my weak subject.
I want to buy this jacket.
I'm happy to wait.
Tom was worried that he might be late.
The drink is on me.
Tom rushed past me.
Tom got up to help Mary.
There's another way.
I'm emotionally drained.
Thanks for the party.
I feel like Tom got the short end of the stick.
I'd rather do something else.
Will you tell Tom?
Mary is not my type.
We'd never survive another attack.
The baby kept quiet.
I'll pass.
Does Tom really want me to come to his party?
Should we get him?
The police have cleared the square.
Show us where you found him.
I have aphthous ulcers on the back of my throat.
Tom chuckled at Mary's joke.
Neither joy nor sorrow can last forever.
Tom fell through the ice.
I know how Tom treated Mary.
He likes ham and eggs.
They won't back off.
We all have secrets.
I've gotten better.
People often complain of how others treat them unjustly, failing to perceive that their own behaviour is quite objectionable.
I have a good crew.
Tom was by far the best singer tonight.
He commanded me to shut the gate.
I wish Tom was here.
How can I reach you?
Tom appeared busy.
I don't see anyone.
Tell us what that is.
Tom is looking pretty good.
Where did you get that?
This is no place for children.
Bring her inside.
We're proud of you.
Did Mary tell you that she thinks Tom and me are dating?
I thought we were friends.
Tom didn't try to argue with Mary.
I have many vices, but fast food isn't one of them.
Tom wished he could've stayed longer.
I'll go to the park.
There were many rotten apples in the basket.
Tom's pulse is weak.
I was hoping for something a little more helpful.
I want you to call her now.
I have sunglasses.
Take Tom out of here.

Do not belittle his suggestions.
If I were you, I'd stay away from Tom for a while.
Tom asked Mary for some help.
I'll go talk to Tom.
Please wait a bit.
I pierced one.
Maybe Tom was lucky.
The worst kind of hangover is emotional hangover.

In this city finding a taxi is complicated.
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom climbed up the ladder.
Let's do the dishes.
Everybody was looking for Tom.
It was really dark.
Since when?
He opened the cages.
This is doable.
The plan won't work.
That is not art. That is a vagina with teeth.
It began to sprinkle.
The rumors were true.
Does Tom have ponytail?
Tom got off the bus.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
It is a white lie.
My grandmother is very old.
I couldn't get Tom to buy that, no matter what I tried.
It's hard to justify.
I find striptease frustrating, as it doesn't often culminate in actual sex.
Where is the laundry?
Just don't drop it.
That's the way it is.
It's deeper than that.
He's a very lucky man.
We're used to that.
She's Tom's sister.
Why did you buy that one?
I think my parents are hiding something from me.
He heard the news on the radio.
We had an oral exam.
That's certainly one possibility.
I want to hear from her.
The girls laughed.
I'll let Tom know what you've done.
It's quiet.
Now it's too late.
Let's find him.
I just wish I knew what to say to Tom.
I've got to try to find them.
We're meditating.
A sharp knife is nothing without a sharp eye.
The percentage of carbohydrates in animal cells is approximately 6 percent.
I'm the victim here.
We'll drive.
What did you feel?
They may have hostages.
He came, he saw - and didn't say anything.
Tom laughed all the time.
Don't mix business with pleasure.
She explained the rules in detail.
Can I still get something to eat?
Tom often talks about you.
I hear you retired.
What Tom said was inappropriate.
We were just playing.
I did everything for him.
Tom is hardly moving.
I came to ask him a favor.
Nobody believed Tom.
I have a runny nose.
Tom's the best guitarist I've ever heard in person.
Let me give you a kiss.
You'd be a great mother.
I didn't notice it.
I went home.
I'd rather not discuss them.
Let's suppose that she was here.
That must be awful.
Did you buy this for us?
I'll miss you, too.
That obliges me to change my opinion.
We got into a fight.
We go to the Buddhist shrine. It is beautiful.
I was disappointed because you weren't at home.
Can you try?
He gave me the salt.
Who should I be talking to?
Did you hear a knock?
Nobody can hurt me without my permission.
This doesn't burn.
It's warm.
It was disgusting.
You are a teacher.
The sky's getting darker.
I played here last week.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Have they arrived yet?
What is it you like about them?
I'll get around to it.
I almost got killed.
It's getting dark.
I don't think that I'll be able to solve this problem by myself.
Mary took maternity leave.
Don't bark!
Mariner 10 was the first space probe to visit Mercury. It was also the first probe to visit two planets - Venus and Mercury.

I'm glad Tom is safe.
My boss was very strict.
Tom, where are you?
I talked to my advisors about which classes to take.
Tom gave Mary a nice present.
Tom coughed again.
This is an easy one.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I was in Canada then.
If I'd known that it would come to this, I would have never consented.
Tom and Mary took turns.
Tell Tom in person.
Tom didn't talk to Mary all night.
I didn't want to rush into anything.
We are going to do this the right way.
He who makes the mistake bears the consequences.
I'm totally not exaggerating.
Try to figure it out.
Tom is a scrawny kid.
I'm going to have to ask you to put your phone away.
Tom sat on the couch.
Do they work here?
There is some truth in what Tom says.
Don't waste so much time!
He made an important discovery.
Tom told me that he would like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
It's a pheasant.
Tom invited us to have dinner with him and his wife.
I just drove down here from Boston.
Rape is a horrible crime.
How many more hours will it be until the party begins?
I'm a little busy.
Tom told Mary that she should get rid of the evidence.
I'd have to agree with that.
Tom thought that Mary would probably be willing to help.
There's one born every minute.
Tom wanted to move to Boston.
We can change things.
You must leave now.
I have one.
It's not too much.
I'm waiting for Tom to cool down.
I don't like alcohol, period.
Try something new.
Call them now.
Tom is wearing leather shorts.
Tom put his hands over Mary's mouth.
Add the onion.
I haven't found a doctor yet.
I saw what happened.
I've lost something.
He hit me on the head.
It snowed more this year than last.
Tom said he would leave at 2:30.
Tell me the rest.
Does Tom attend mass?
I'm the one who takes out the garbage.
I always feel sleepy.
I'm touched by your concern.
Tom looked through the peephole in the door.
There's a good restaurant not too far from here.
Tom didn't look busy.
It's noisy next door.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom was waiting to see what would happen.
Mary said that Tom was too importunate, or something along those lines.
The rainwater evaporates on a hot day.
I broke a glass - try not to step on the shards before I clean them up.
Could I borrow a pen?
What time did Tom say his party was going to start?
I think Tom is right.
I always wanted to hear that piece.
Tom tried to get Mary's attention.
Is that the belt I gave you?
Tom isn't outgoing.
Why don't we ask her to help?
We've just arrived.
Tom is very upset.
'OK' is said to be the most popular word in the world.
You are impossible.
I have just returned.
Someone called Tom.
Do you have a tie I can borrow?
The magazines were sold out.
You can't help her anymore.
What was Tom working on?
Tom told Mary not to be late again.
Tom tried to make up for his lack of sleep by taking a nap.
Her beauty will fade in time.
Tom wasn't sure if he could do it or not.
I have a question for him.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Nothing scares Tom.
We need a plan first.
I want you to look for them.
Tom caught Mary looking at him.
My dog bit him.
It was awfully funny.
Tom neglected his work.
Leave my room immediately.
I'm in command now.
Tom drank the potion.
Tom turned on the fan.
There seemed to be nothing we could do.
Tom thought it looked cool.
Stop talking to me.
Tom is jumping rope.
Tom told us not to park in front of his house.
Mary showed her breasts.
I'm glad you're home.
I know what got her rattled.
A savage tribe lived there in those days.
I think there's a place for you here.
Tom cut the pear in half.
I had to stay behind.
You'll understand when the time comes.
Do you think we shouldn't have told Tom about this?
Does this mean anything to Dan?
Somebody might've followed Tom.
My father used to take me here when I was young .
Perhaps we should do something about it.
Tom started working.
You have to get us out of here.
I'm feeling embarrassed right now.
How long has Tom been living in Boston?
I'm so grateful.
Are they going to arrest me?
Everybody got scared.
What will you make?
Yes, Bob helped me.
Does Tom know why you don't like him?
The knife had a very sharp point.
Suspicion is destructive of friendship.
Did you call him yet?
She winked at him.
Nothing bothers us.
I asked her to come with me.
Tom drinks black coffee without sugar.
I tried to convince Tom.
Tom wouldn't take no for an answer.
We all like you.
I hate asparagus.
I've always thought you knew how to speak French.
The one who pays the bills calls the shots.
Don't mess with Tom.
You can do better than that.
They weren't hungry.
Are you good at math?
I couldn't hear him.
Tom served dinner.
Tom looked a little shocked.
I think Tom is hiding something from us.
He worked last night without taking a break.
Will you give me something cold to drink?
Why are you crying?
I think you'll have to help us.
What's the answer?
Can you come with us, please?
Good luck.
I thought you'd like to know that Tom was absent from school today.
Tom hasn't called Mary yet.
She invited me to the ballet.
This jacket is too small for me.
Tom is extremely smart.
We're doing our best.
This is a pun.
I see what Tom meant.
Tom has offered to take care of the children this afternoon.
I'm not sure that I'm going to Tom's wedding.
I'm sure Tom feels the same way.
I asked them to come.
The question is who is going to tell him.
You have to follow the rules.
All I know is that Tom is supposed to be here by 2:30.
We should talk first.
I'm for it.
They were on sale.
Are you really sure that this is what you want to do?
Try to resist.
We're not so sure.
We were so young at that time.
You said you would text me in the evening, but you lied, evidently.
I know about the job.
We were all rooting for you.
I don't think there's any way out of this one.
Did Tom have a gun?
Tom didn't eat much.
They fought for freedom.
Is Tom still awake?
Tom looks like himself again.
It won't be easy to forget you.
My French still isn't very good.
They're useless now.
We'll contact you.
They don't really care.
It's been nice talking to you, but I really must go now.
Is that why you won't help us?
I saw an explosion.
We're not smiling.
I'm sorry for what happened to Tom.
I wouldn't want to intrude.
What do you have there?
I'm sure Tom can do it.
He called for help.
This is not a trick.
It is obvious that his condition has not worsened.
You aren't what I expected.
I've always believed in you.
Who ran for president that year?
Tom isn't here, I assure you.
Tom needs surgery.
Do you have change for a fifty?
Get some sleep if you can.
Nobody can stop Tom.
Should I include Tom?
Tom signed the bill.
I couldn't spot Tom.
Is that a yes or no?
I'll tell Tom you called.
I'm on medication.
Tom is downstairs.
I left a message for them.
I blame her.
Tom seemed to remember what happened better than anyone else.
Should we wait for her?
Tom seemed to expect nothing.
How did they leave?
Tom misjudged Mary.
It is unwise to keep two snakes in one tank.
Put it down.
It's completely dark.
The bandits put a gag in his mouth.
We got carried away with our conversation.
Tom is really nice.
Toby can't tell jokes.
How many atoms are there in a drop of water?
Is this pencil yours?
You can't take that.
Tom gave up smoking.
Tom is not jealous.
Tom abandoned them.
Did you poison Tom?
Dan cut himself shaving.
Tom was mad at Mary.
I'm making a movie.
Look out your window.
When will that be?
Magnets attract iron.
Tom didn't exactly tell the truth.
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't forgive him.
I thought that you said you wanted to go with us.
I'm going to go get them.
Back away from her.
I love golf.
Tom thanked the chef.
How about playing golf this afternoon?
We wouldn't stand a chance.
Drive slowly.
Cigarettes are soothers for adults.
I went to bed late in the night.
I bought it from them.
I like butterflies.
He won't let anybody sit in his armchair.
Tom never knew that I secretly hated him.
I needed it.
I like movies a lot.
My grandfather was a miller.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
Mary has beautiful brown eyes.
Tom was afraid of you.
Is Tom a prisoner?
I'll help find him.
The book is in the room.
Don't make me laugh.
Mary is pretty cute.
There are two chests of drawers in this bedroom.
My husband is in high spirits today.
They should wash their feces.
I'll alert them.
I got your address from him.
I was just looking for him.
Have Tom come see me.
I'm hoping to find him.
Tom told me not to open that door.
What can you expect?
Write the answer on this piece of paper, please.
Get her away from here.
The more I eat the bigger my appetite gets.
I will give a bunch of flowers to my girlfriend.
Let's get ready to leave.
Don't call me a jerk.
I'm a good listener.
I'd have understood.
Tom isn't the one who borrowed my car.
Are you kidding me?
Let me try again.
I could walk from here.
I miss my mom's cooking.
You're after them.
Every Harlot was a Virgin once.
I like to listen to Tom's stories.
I'm really worried about her.
We'd better hurry.
Tom often cuts classes on Monday.
Your castle is under attack.
You said we'd never catch them.
That's someone else's problem.
Who likes insects?
He must be homesick.
Give me a toothpick.
George, I have something to tell you. You have a mother, don't you?
Shut up and do it.
Thanks for helping out.
Let's not get cocky.
This is a photo of my painting.
Tom sliced the apple.
I'm still running a little bit late.
Tom met Mary in the park on his way home from work.
I always lock my room.
Are you able to swim?
What's the forecast for tomorrow?
There was only one small problem.
Tom is still being questioned by the police.
What brings you to Boston?
Do you have a stomach ache?
You're impressive.
Crossing that desert is dangerous.
Tom loves Australia.
Fatherland or death, we shall overcome.
We'll help you out.
Tom is a sophomore.
Dan and his friends gathered outside the police station.
What an idiotic mistake!
Tom greeted everyone.
They betrayed you.
People tend to like me.
Does this belong to you?
Everyone turned to look at him.
This candlestick is very heavy.
I, too, am worried about him.
We're getting warmer.
Well, what sports do you like?
I tried my best to help him.
The speaker cleared his throat.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
Hold onto your hats.
Why did you leave your job?
I tried to find him.
Whatever you do, do it quickly.
I wonder what it would be like to be Tom.
Thanks for the gift.
You are not Japanese.
I don't think Tom and Mary have much in common.
Why did they attack you?
Do you want a hug?
I won't breathe a word.
Her whole body hurt.
All men have fullfilled their duty.
Tom brought a pie.
They did very well.
Why are you going in costume this year?
Tom is egotistical.
Tom put the box in the car.
They won't find her there.
Tom gave Mary a hand.
Sit on the bench.
We'll bring her.
Tom can't be missing.
Let's not talk about her.
I was right behind him.
Do you meditate, Tom?
I'm still your boss.
Why didn't you ask?
It'd be a pleasure to be a godmother to your son!
I think I'll see if I can do this by myself.
Dan really believes that the whole world revolves around him.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Who gave you that recipe book?
No one's allowed in.
Ask them instead.
You found them, didn't you?
Tom's not breathing.
Where were you planning on putting all this stuff?
Tom couldn't restrain himself.
It happened two years ago.
I'm seeing someone.
In the end he achieved his goal.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin like most vampires.
Tom was unsociable.
It's technically possible.
What did you think we were talking about?
We'll come together.
Sorry to impose, but would you please open the window?
She is a graceful beauty.
Sign your name there.
Masturbation is doing it with someone you really love.
I've had enough for one day.
All I have is a book.
How did you guess that?
How do we find out?
We've never talked about that.
The more you have, the more you have to lose.
I'm in love, and I am unhappy about it.
Poor me.
I can't recall a good way to get there.
I'll do as you say.
My grandfather raises ducks.
Tom ran away with the money.
Is Tom there alone?
You chose a good one.
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Tom is sometimes absent from work.
I'm determined to solve this puzzle before I go home today.
Tom is going to be proud of you.
My grandmother is sick.
It was very exciting.
I didn't say I knew how to speak French.
They understood that.
You may leave now.
Tom lit the stove.
We're saved.
Tom drank a lot of coffee so he could stay awake.
I thought you said you could swim.
What's the golden rule?
I can do better than that.
Is it possible we've made a mistake?
The dough is still a little thick.
There was complete silence.
Boston is a nice city.
The church bell used to ring at three.
Tom has regained consciousness.
Take us with you, Tom.
It's not there.
But for your help, he would have failed.
Tom would say yes.
Tom isn't the one, is he?
I left Boston a long time ago.
Tom looks pleased with himself.
That's why I'm still alive.
I don't want a birthday party this year.
I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how to do that.
You need new clothes.
Tom and Mary are going to play tennis this afternoon.
I admire your talent.
The marvel is that he knew it.
I'd say that's a good idea.
Where did Tom live?
Have Tom join us.
You won't win.
We can make a deal.
You got the answer right.
There is wax on the carpet.
I have nothing against her.
The palace has a tall tower.
Did you bring rolls?
What does the doctor think is wrong?
I'm still talking.
I thought you wouldn't be so busy.
Just make this stop.
Let's have her decide.
I think he is honest.
Why are you so smart?
Dan came to London with just two hundred pounds.
That's why some veterans never wanted to talk about the war.
Tom is sound asleep.
I can't fool around any longer.
Will you lubricate the car?
Did Tom look happy to go?
You must accept your role.
Did you do it just for kicks?
It's up one floor.
I'm going to become the best.
Can we call her now?
I'm not rich enough to buy cheap things.
That's what I'd tell Tom.
This will do for now.
Tom is working fast.
Dan wanted to improve the lives of others.
That's what happened to us.
She got a proper telling-off.
Everyone laughed except you.
The hill is exposed, with no trees.
He proposed that we take a small break.
We stared at them.
Tom is Mary's father.
I baked some cookies for him.
Tom is one of a kind.
Water pipes are cylinders.
We'll pray for them.
I didn't see it.
Could you slow down?
Show me your hands.
Tom is asking for it.
Next spring I want to graduate.
Tom might possibly have been the one who did that.
Tom is a botanist.
But let me remind you of one thing.
Tom always had pets when he was growing up.
"Shall I heat your meal?" "Oh, yes please."
Why don't you do what Tom asked you?
Tom is impressive.
The pigeons' feathers are white.
I was hoping you'd be here today.
Aren't you having fun, Tom?
The doctor gave her morphine.
It looks real to me.
Are you almost ready?
It's a stupid policy.
There must have been some more tea in the pot.
When did you ask her to be your girlfriend?
Tom wasn't able to get a visa.
Can you tell me about yourself?
Did you buy this for him?
Tom thinks he's better at French than he really is.
Tom nodded as if he understood what Mary was talking about.
I didn't sneak up on Tom.
That was my mistake.
Fools are happy.
Draw a line with a ruler.
We need a safety net.
Tom seems prepared.
Tom was breathing heavily.
That's totally irresponsible.
I think you're going to like Tom.
I'm still doing it.
I think it's working.
I think I can get them to help.
They still want it.
Tom is a quiet person.
How can we save the earth?
Are you comfortable?
He has a lot of money.
All right, listen carefully.
I'm just happy to be able to help.
You're staying with Tom, right?
Tom has disappeared.
Let's get her out of here.
You two just looked so happy together.
How old were you when you learned to write your name?
Tom has good manners.
Hi, are you Tom?
Let's take our seats.
We can't go outside because it's raining.
This is utter nonsense.
Just go back home.
We're made for each other.
The next artist is amazing.
Tom spends all his time thinking about sports.
He tried again.
You're overweight.
I can't believe how irresponsible you are.
Tom is our new colleague.
Her father's name's Carlos Antonio. Her boyfriend's Carlos Miguel.
We made you a cake.
What do you mean, you don't know that?
It's boiling in here.
Is somebody there?
Tom is a bad liar.
This is not the best solution.
What was that for?
It is true he is rich, but he is a miser.
That is moderately beautiful.
I'm going downstairs.
Add a little more pepper.
I got bad news from home today.
I can't do any more than that.
This famous conductor lives in New York.
Don't cheat.
Can I call you a cab?
I've been trying everything.
You are a friend of Tom's, aren't you?
Tom wanted to know why Mary was absent.
Have you been smoking?
It's not ridiculous.
This is just what I need.
When Tom died, I wanted to die.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
You need to go back.
Don't talk about this to anyone.
He was so angry that his veins stood out.
What did Tom suggest?
Where is the embassy?
Karim has a significant role in the movie.
I didn't attack Tom.
Tom didn't sound as enthusiastic as Mary.
We're out of bullets.
Where did the mugging take place?
I'd like to visit Boston before I die.
I turned thirteen in 2003.
He won't like this.
People stopped and stared at Tom.
This is a breakfast.
Mary is a potter.
I'm going to wash my carriage.
Look around.
Tell me if you find a boyfriend.
What to do next is the question.
It doesn't come without a price.
Nobody likes rats.
Wouldn't that be dangerous?
Tom hugged me.
Would you do me a favour?
I thought I could help Tom.
But that isn't true.
Is that necessary?
Are you two about finished?
Tom has an ugly face.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
It was unthinkable.
We'll do this later.
I'm finished with you.
The answer was yes.
I've always been afraid that this would happen.
Tom's a very bad guy.
Tell me it's true.
Tom liked his job.
Tom got into a fight with Mary's brother and got his nose broken.
Tom is good with puzzles.
Tom never seems to be very happy.
Tom boarded the bus.
That wasn't funny.
Tom stayed behind.
We belong together.
Should I call them?
Tom grabbed the book from Mary.
Tom is last.
We're sick.
I'll get the wine.
You make me blush.
It was just a wish.
I don't like to plan too much.
We ate potato soup.
Mary was very supportive.
Tom is our client.
He's a fine young man.
The girl stood looking into the mirror.
I'll find someone to help us.
It's very cold today.
When did he get back?
They hated her.
You must've had a good time.
Why do you know that?
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
If you're not watching the TV, I'll turn it off.
Tom actually laughed.
She looked furious.
Just don't let it ever happen again.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
It's a weird question.
Get that away from me.
Tom admires Mary's singing ability.
If you're not happy, quit.
She is really cute.
Are Tom and Mary getting along?
Tom was almost right.
Tom needs clothes.
My grandfather cannot walk without a walking stick.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
I've been forgetting things lately.
Tom gave me a surfboard.
There's no use arguing.
I just need you to trust me.
She loved him with all her heart.
I'm ready to begin.
I enjoy a challenge.
Tom is a scumbag.
Tom was interested in that.
I have no choice but to leave.
There's so much to say.
Get away from that.
Basically, I am a honest person.
"He used to love me," she answered sadly.
He's a pediatrician.
He types extremely fast but with lots of mistakes.
A good medicine tastes bitter.
Tom seems stressed.
You look distressed.
Maybe this weekend we could go to the beach together.
This is a great business opportunity.
I make a mean margarita.
This is the city where he was born.
I can't dance either.
I know one of them but not the other.
I killed them both.
Tom is angry with us.
I have to get home.
You probably think I'm a creep.
I'll go and see if I can get Tom to help.
I can't forget Mary.
I bought it from Tom.
Tom welded the two pipes together.
How well did you really know Tom?
Handsome women age far better than pretty women.
Nobody's volunteered.
Don't let him down.
Bush knows what justice means.
Do you want to sit?
We're back.
Tom loves to party.
The work must be completed at once.
We need to follow them.
Get off of me.
Did you call me?
We needed some privacy.
I'm the one who should be doing that.
You pay attention to me?
Who's with Tom now?
Have you ever sucked a penis?
Tom is very funny.
Your job must keep you pretty busy.
You were almost there.
Give me ten minutes.
We'll take good care of Tom.
Everyone's watching.
Tom was thirsty, so he drank a glass of water.
Tom raised his glass.
I love comedies.
I won't beg for my life.
Daddy used to say that time is money.
You bastard, I'll kill you!
Watch out for Tom.
I still think we should've offered to help.
You could say that.
His soul was in heaven.
I dislike cold weather.
Tom wasn't punished.
Wanna crash at my place?
She defeated him.
Tom is still a virgin.
Tom suggested to Mary that she offer John a cup of coffee.
That's disturbing.
Tom told Mary that she couldn't just make up the rules as she went along.
Tom never laughed.
Where are you off to?
Tom chopped some onions.
He didn't come, with the excuse that he was sick.
I'll see you again.
They worked together to extinguish the fire.
I thought you were going to be here yesterday.
I am hungry.
How can you trust Tom?
Tom and Mary are almost done.
You did this to me.
Tom isn't so certain.
Tom closed the lid.
Tom was 30 years old.
I'm still mad at Tom.
Tom is quite fussy.
Can't you see that Tom needs your help?
We've seen it before.
I'm searching for food.
The airport was new. I went inside and had a look.
There's someone behind them.
I know you worry about him.
Where do you think Tom wants to spend his summer vacation?
He likes salads that contain sour cream.
She is a glutton.
Tom could be a cop.
Something's bothering her.
I thought you might be interested in knowing.
My passport has expired.
He is in trouble now.
His statements are childish and they often bother me.
We're at home today.
Tom sat down by the fire.
It seemed like a reasonable compromise.
What is your mission?
We're really scared.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Tom said he didn't want to go with us.
It was a great show.
Tom took the eggs out of the carton one by one.
My cat is happy.
I'm quite comfortable with my decision.
Tom looked through his binoculars.
Did I mention that?
Only love can break your heart.
Did you get an answer from them?
I just wanted to help you.
How much time have we got left?
People are trying to eat around here.
We're done.
This cow is not branded.
I can't find the equation.
I'm sure Tom will feel the same.
Tom decided to help out.
It's wonderful.
Is it far from here?
I survived.
The girl hops.
Is it all paid for?
Don't speak to me that way!
You have a big nose.
What Tom saw made him nervous.
That was never an option.
He can swim a mile.
Tom was good at that.
I didn't wait for them.
Blood is the fluid responsible for the circulation of nutrients.
This doesn't concern us.
This is your problem.
Tom wasn't moving.
Their marriage is a sham.
You can put it down now.
We'll be late for class.
Love me little, love me long.
It'll be therapeutic.
I liked your speech.
That's what I told the police.
Greek philosophers placed value on democracy.
There's the doctor.
How far are you from here?
We're with the FBI.
We'll drive Tom home.
Do you speak Italian?
I think maybe you're wrong.
Tom said that he thought Mary was asleep.
You're sick!
Go brush your teeth.
I'm glad I don't need that.
What a pair!
I actually haven't been to Boston yet.
He suddenly fell ill.
Weren't you crying?
What'll you have to drink?
We're getting fat.
Tom said he couldn't remember that guy's name.
Are you sure there isn't any easier way to do this?
I wish you were dead.
They agreed on everything.
You're OK.
Tom wouldn't mind.
Let's try.
Sunshine is beneficial to plants.
I've come to warn you about what's going to happen.
Look at us.
He stood by himself.
Tom said to say hello.
Nobody came.
Let's get Tom to bed.
Just stay focused.
I won't forget you.
Tom is at most 13 years old.
I'm coming for you.
It took time.
Don't call me again.
Have you called him?
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in jail.
I suspect that Tom isn't telling the truth.
Tom is already there.
It wasn't a surprise.
Tom became a manager.
I really like that car.
Why won't Tom talk to us?
That shouldn't be hard.
I recommend this brand of coffee.
What color are those?
You shouldn't ever have to do this again.
Tom is quite the catch.
Tom isn't to blame.
Language is the means by which people communicate with others.
I love autumn.
I don't know the way.
It doesn't look like you're very happy.
I'm all set to start.
It is of little value.
The boat capsized.
You'll be terrific.
May I use this bat?
Do you think you'll need Tom's help?
I'm not teaching them languages.
"Are you straight or gay?" "I'm straight."
The king is naked!
I hated Tom.
They said they're hungry.
We miss you.
Enter the delivery address.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
I haven't had a boyfriend in ages.
We'd better go in there and get Tom.
I still believe in love.
The rumor's all over town.
How long was your visit?
I'll cook you anything you want.
I can get you a deal.
How deep is this lake?
Tom is dealing drugs.
Contribute to Tatoeba.
Tom honked at Mary.
Why don't we go in?
Go to the living room.
I want to find her.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
Tom's doing OK.
Life without books is unimaginable.
That's not acceptable.
Tom has a bad temper.
I'll come as soon as I can.
Your sweater is on backwards.
Can you call me back later?
I think he's correct.
Why do we need to find her?
They grow oranges in California.
I didn't tell on you.
Was the door open?
We try.
Can Tom be trusted?
Not all people are evil bastards.
Tom was the third victim.
Even if I am wrong, you are not quite right.
That's my umbrella.
Stay away from them.
Tom knew this meant trouble.
I really like it when you say my name.
Do you know of any good Japanese movies to watch?
Tom has a big family.
Tom continued pacing.
Tom is supervising.
I've some minutes left.
He doesn't like us.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please sit down.
Go for help.
It's not subjective.
I don't want my mother to worry.
You have a small chest.
No matter how tired you are, that work has to be finished today.
We've got to move.
That was unfortunate.
I'm not talking about you.
Why did you become a cop?
Ravens are said to live much longer than humans.
I'll take your word on that.
I've never read any of the classics.
I know what's going to happen.
Tom collects antiques.
Now let's get some sleep.
You'd better look out.
Turn it off.
Someone stepped on my foot.
I can't see.
The face betrays what is in the heart.
I don't know how to say how sorry I really am.
They both chuckled.
What should we do instead?
I overheard your conversation.
They've got friends.
I wonder if Tom likes beer.
I think I'll go out to eat.
Tom lied about what had happened.
Did you get a receipt?
I have a big house.
She likes short skirts.
I need to look at my notes.
I met a certain gentleman at the station.
It's instinct.
They'll be safe here.
I don't have time to be sick.
He attained his goal.
You remind me of somebody.
I don't keep secrets from you.
Can you do anything to help them?
I used to try really hard to get straight As.
How many years is it now that we've known each other?
Even goats have beards.
I was all by myself.
It's still frozen.
Welcome.
I captured butterflies with a net.
Tom was paid to lose.
Tom can't stop us.
Tom said that there was one left.
Laughter is contagious.
You don't give a shit, do you?
I found something that I think you might want to read.
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
Wouldn't you like to go out and get something to eat?
I have enough time for that.
You should get a good night's sleep.
I couldn't ask her for money.
Why don't I take Tom?
This man is a linguist. It's natural that he know.
There's no such thing.
This isn't about me.
Do you smell smoke?
Nothing's good enough for you.
Tom practiced his scales all day.
See you on the plane.
Who's the guy over there?
I've got to see Tom.
I've got a secret.
That looks like Tom.
So what did you do?
Are you unhappy, Tom?
You're such a drama queen.
Why doesn't anybody help them?
Your sister's sleeping.
You need to buy some sugar.
Birds are flying in the air.
Lucky, aren't you?
I don't like them at all.
I baked some cookies for them.
It's coming loose.
I can take you there.
I had a vision.
You two are funny.
Let's get him out of here.
How was the meeting yesterday?
No jokes please!
They are looking at themselves in the mirror.
"Are you a vegetarian?" - "No, are you?"
We need to buy them presents.
I came here to study.
Tom says he feels fine.
Bring him over.
Why did you do this?
We all fell asleep.
They sell furniture.
I don't want to rest.
Don't count on Tom.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but we have a big problem.
Dan is moving out on the first.
I knew I could trust Tom.
I also feel the same way.
Answer me right now.
Finish boiling the carrots.
Tom is getting bored.
Let's go get a beer.
Tom is my boyfriend.
I bought a pair of gloves.
I don't like beets.
Put that fire out.
I've got no friends.
Last summer was awful.
I'm ready for him now.
Tom stood up again.
Can you tell me more about them?
I often skip breakfast.
Something isn't right here.
Please open this box.
Tom started shooting.
The war is not inevitable.
Please don't be sad.
That's precisely what I meant.
It would be nice if there were more money.
I wish I hadn't believed him.
Strange, isn't it?
Tom was breathing deeply.
You might be interested to know that Tom has a Ph.D.
I'm nervous.
I'll talk to you soon.
Tom ate all the ice cream that was in the freezer.
You're a complete misanthrope.
Nothing bothers her.
How long will it take to get to Boston?
"Steffi, will you marry me?" "How much money do you have?"
Are you teasing me?
Why do I have to be here?
I think Tom is ready.
I want you.
Do you really want to break my heart?
It resembles a wedding.
Do you know how they knew?
We're trying to get to Boston.
A crystal chandelier was hanging over the table.
You won't make it, not even in your dreams.
Tom can speak French better than you think he does.
I remember you often went to Betty's house to tea when you were a little girl.
Please give me money.
I think I'm going to pass this class.
She got a proper telling-off.
We must assume the worst.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
He doesn't like fish.
You might be able to help them.
You must talk to Tom.
Tom lit the candles.
Nobody really wants us here.
Was there an autopsy?
We need time to mourn.
He is an atheist.
I couldn't hear her.
Give them some privacy.
Why do you need a new television?
Tom brought Mary a small gift.
Do we have another one like this?
Is someone knocking on the door?
Have you ever tasted anything Tom's cooked?
I'm going out of my mind.
They can leave.
I'm upset about him.
No problem, of course, if you're going.
That's child's play.
The peasantry revolted wielding pitchforks and clubs.
I've been after them for a long time.
We're like family.
Tom was concerned.
Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
I ate fish yesterday.
Tom stopped writing.
I'm sure Tom will help us.
They didn't mean any harm.
Why aren't they here?
Why aren't you ready?
What happened to the generator?
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror.
Where did you ever find her?
This is my daughter.
I just talked to Tom.
I hardly ever go out.
I am deeply ashamed.
I know what that's worth.
That's a funny one.
My whole family perished in the fire.
I postponed the event.
I'm not a good liar.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
I have a list here.
You can't put toothpaste back in the tube.
I'll give her that.
I was surprised when Tom said he was applying for a job at our company.
Tom told us to leave.
She was right the first time.
I no longer live in Boston.
I couldn't get them to wake up.
Finishing the report by 2:30 shouldn't be too difficult.
I'll try to control myself.
What do you like about them?
Dan shared personal information with Linda.
Tell Tom I'll be right over.
I think there's still a chance Tom will get here on time.
It may be too late already.
Let's sing and dance.
I wasn't worried about that.
Around the city ran a river.
I was so wrong about her.
I wish I were rich.
We can't help you.
I'll do as I please.
This room smells funny.
How's Tom been treating you?
You're my neighbor.
Did you know Tom was a vegetarian?
Which best describes his actions?
Did you buy one yet?
He's waiting for the train to leave.
Tom's daughter was murdered.
Tom will go first.
Tom walked to the door and looked out.
Dan was thrown out of the club.
You're very disobedient.
There was no way out.
Why does this keep happening?
Sadder than the beggar is the man who eats alone in public.
We didn't find them.
Let's see if Tom is at home.
Tom's dog barks a lot.
I'm sick and tired of eating the same thing for lunch every day.
I told you I don't know anything.
Is it your helicopter?
How long have you been a doctor here?
You're almost young enough to be my daughter.
Tom'll reconsider.
She will give birth soon.
She lived there by herself.
What're you up to?
Tom has been close.
Tom is sleeping in his chair.
There are many strange ingredients in that soup.
English is not my maternal language and I realize that I still have a lot to learn.
This is much worse.
Don't pressure Tom.
It's a doll.
Tom didn't say so.
I enjoyed swimming.
I am coming.
Mary barely touched her food.
Although I am a pious man, I am not the less a man.
I haven't called him yet.
They don't want you.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
Why would Tom stay?
I was lying earlier.
It's a stupid idea.
He held his breath.
I should've worn a short-sleeve shirt.
Why should I worry about him?
Are you going to cry?
Don't give it to Tom.
I grew up in Boston.
Tom can't make it.
What else do you know about that?
Tom is filling a bottle with water.
Can you give me a ride home?
They are treating me like a child.
Take off your hat.
I didn't know she was that old.
Can you read phonetic symbols?
Can I stay at your place? I have nowhere to go.
Do we have to help them?
It was very late at night.
I have to leave again.
Tom is rational.
How much is that TV over there, please?
He will be punished.
Mary clobbered Tom with a skillet.
I have some good news.
The gun was Tom's.
How did Tom get in?
I'm sure you'll come up with something.
How long has Tom been in Boston?
I'm watching my weight.
He also speaks French.
I'm not going to explain it to you again.
I'm sorry I couldn't help him.
You'll embarrass him.
We never use them.
Tom looks pleased.
I'm not miserable.
Hold the rope tight.
Tom paid cash.
Try it out.
Please keep the children busy.
I've already considered that possibility.
Tom is very good at it.
Tom wanted us to investigate the murder of his wife.
Let's meet in front of the library.
They didn't say why.
I'm here by choice.
This is a happy occasion.
I haven't yet made up my mind.
I don't hear barking.
Let's not go home.
Stop that noise.
I heard a door slam.
I have a delivery for her.
I was thinking about Boston.
These are perfect.
I have a package here for him.
I feel blue.
Tetanus continues to kill!
I got married again.
She borrowed his hoodie.
I'm sick of this war.
I need some advice.
We made a bargain.
Tom won't open the door.
Tom's face reddened.
I answered no.
"What do you want me to tell Tom?" "The truth." "That's a bad idea."
Tom is sick.
It was impressive.
We'll work it out.
I'm looking out for him.
When did you go to work?
Next year my birthday will fall on a Sunday.
It helps.
Are you sure this is where we're supposed to turn?
Give me some money.
Tom tells it like it is.
She borrowed a saw from the farmer.
We'll try to get there early enough to help you set things up.
Natural resources are not limitless.
Butterflies have short life spans.
The rain whipped against the window.
Tom thanked Mary for the bottle of wine she gave him.
Time has no end. It's endless.
Don't stand near me.
It fits perfectly.
My sister likes looking after my son, but still I'm the one who has to change his nappy all the time.
We were in Boston all weekend.
I'm supposed to be helping Tom right now.
I have bad eyesight.
Tom gave Mary a push.
Women seem to go for Tom.
Tom told Mary that he had to leave before 2:30.
Tom looks puzzled.
I couldn't kill you.
I tripped on a stone, and if he hadn't caught me, I would have fallen into the gorge.
Izen moved back to the shadows, hiding behind the throne once more.
Do you know what to write?
Where am I?
I thought I'd never find them.
Tom barely touched his food.
I just can't do that.
I am ready for the storm.
Tom is sitting on a park bench, looking miserable.
They aren't alone.
I looked for them.
We often have traveled to Tokyo.
Tom wants you to eat.
I really needed that.
Bill searched the entire house.
Can you answer that?
Tom took a screwdriver out of the tool chest.
Maybe Tom was the one who stole Mary's necklace.
Why is Tom special?
I can barely see you.
I'm just fucking with you, man. You've paid your taxes on time! You can leave if you want.
Tom has a short fuse.
I was just looking out for him.
If I'm not mistaken, the problem is we are out of gas.
They detest him.
I have to prepare for my presentation.
Tom needs the money.
I'm looking for an engagement ring.
He is a nice person.
Is French pronunciation difficult?
Can you make it work?
I'm in need of money.
Tom had no choice.
These images are beautiful.
In sports, there is no room for failure.
After working zealously, we were refreshed by fruit and water.
Let's give her a little time.
The student is optimistic, but his advisor is a pessimist.
Have you read this yet?
Tom put a cap on his head.
Tom sipped his drink.
I suppose you've been told that before.
Tom plowed the field.
What is in this box?
It was pretty good.
Why did you give up?
I have a chest pain.
Neighbourly relations are necessary for success.
I don't want anyone to panic.
Tom didn't want to go.
Let's meet Tom at the station.
We'll be destroyed.
We want to take it.
You have to sit down.
Fathers are indeed good to their children!
That's my responsibility.
She is always complaining of her poor health.
What a dick!
Something is going on today.
I think Tom will probably be there tonight.
Tom stabbed Mary with a hunting knife.
Why is that crazy?
I let Tom sleep in.
His escape attempt was successful.
You guys wait here.
What're you asking?
You make my job easy.
As soon as it stopped raining a beautiful rainbow appeared.
Everyone's laughing.
I believe you are incorrect.
Tom crossed the room.
What's this used for?
They sat in silence.
She gave me an icy look.
This is Tom, my ex-boyfriend.
I'd ask her.
Quit following Tom.
The knight Tristan loved the princess Iseult.
I've already made amends to most of the people on my list.
You can't tempt me.
Come home before six.
Anything is possible.
Tom can't have understood what you said.
Were you close to your dad?
I set fire to one.
They trapped the fox.
Tom has a mustache.
I have an invitation.
What about you? Do you trust this man?
I will have a driving test tomorrow.
I wouldn't like that either.
Do you think Tom knows Mary is married?
Why are you in the bathroom?
I finally understand.
He has a painting of Jesus Christ in the living room.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
The nurse gave us flu shots.
How large are they?
Can you afford it?
I asked him to join us.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
I don't mean to nag you.
I don't know what's worse: being stupid or pretending to be stupid.
Use your brain.
Do you want more than that?
Do you like your coffee strong?
Don't drive so fast. We're all going to die!
How do you know Tom?
You can't leave Boston today.
I'm OK.
Tom was terribly afraid.
I need a new wardrobe.
That is unavoidable.
I know you love me.
Just take your time.
This is a powerful laser.
We lost.
I'm not pretty.
The best place to hide something is in plain sight.
It has to be true.
Maybe Tom didn't plan to be here this soon.
I need you to leave.
I haven't managed to get help from anyone.
You know something about this, don't you?
I wonder who it was.
When did you buy it?
They all turned to face him.
This is the best way to die.
This video is boring.
What's Tom's shoe size?
He got a broken jaw and lost some teeth.
Those pants are too big.
Who was this poem written by?
I ran out of ideas.
Give him a break.
Everyone stared at her.
In our wide world, there exist countless lifestyles, languages and cultures.
Start over.
I'm strict.
Don't give up. You still have a chance.
You may have made the wrong choice.
Are you two related?
Do you have a freezer?
Whose side are you?
They have company.
Tom said you were good.
Why won't you listen?
You have a passing grade.
We agree.
Tom's socks don't match.
Tom won't be missed.
This isn't like Tom.
There are still some savage tribes on that island.
I don't know why I even thought I had a chance with Tom.
Can you find her for me?
I totally owe you one.
Solving this problem is simple.
Keep Tom out of trouble.
That's why I was there.
I need you to open the door for me.
Tom lived to be 97.
I did it.
This sounds familiar.
I came to kill him.
The food at that restaurant is too greasy for me.
Should we wait for them?
The cat is rolling over on its back.
You must be freezing.
When were you fired?
Tom won't come. He's very busy.
Is that a new jacket?
She suffers from a chronic illness.
This typewriter doesn't work.
This building belongs to my family.
That seems natural.
I think that Tim is a suitable candidate for this job.
Tom was robbed.
I'll obey.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
We are an open community.
Just leave me alone.
We're contributing.
The nurse sat little Tom down and told him to stick out his tongue.
She only buys second-hand clothing.
Tom came last week.
I was just teasing.
My mom told me that I was fat.
It was just a happy accident.
I'm just watching TV.
Ask her yourself.
We went out clubbing.
I was scared of Tom.
My husband is indifferent to his clothes.
Let's see if we can get lucky.
They went there.
There's nobody inside.
How did you get up there?
Meditation brings peace.
The car is very fast.
I have a faint recollection of the event.
You didn't listen.
You don't look all that busy.
Sleep is better than medicine.
I'm engaged to Laurie.
I've always wanted to go to another country.
Why do you need a doctor?
He is from our village.
I met with Tom today.
Did I put too much rum in your drink?
I brought a friend.
His parents were glad at his success in the examination.
He doesn't speak English very well.
Why did you help us escape?
I need three markers.
He was right the first time.
Tom isn't good at making conversation.
I feel really tired.
I'm trying to quit.
Bring them with you.
His hair is so long it reaches the floor.
Tom bowed his head.
Tom looked at Mary, not sure what to say.
You're dependable.
It was very quiet.
They spoke French.
I didn't finish it.
Tom seems unfriendly.
When's Tom expected back?
I'm inclined to believe her.
Get out!
Why do I need to do that?
Tom just didn't like it.
Tom ought not to have spoken to his teacher in that tone of voice.
I didn't expect to be here either.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I like your outfit.
No one's going to find them.
We're going this way.
Do you like my clothes?
I found no job today.
I haven't written anything for months.
We want your advice.
Let's ask Tom what he thinks.
Just sit and relax.
My jeans shrank.
We'll stop along the way.
Tom isn't asking any questions.
Boy was I naive.
You must trust me.
Think for yourself.
Tom hadn't planned to talk to you.
I never had to worry about you.
I want to sleep.
She stuck a poster on the wall.
Give her a moment.
He built a new house.
You can change that.
I've been helping him.
Let me be your shelter.
I showered before breakfast.
I want to come back.
Tom kept on working.
It's impossible to deny the obvious.
Tom understood the risks.
Tom showed us around the city.
Tom could hurt me.
Tom had never kissed a girl before he kissed Mary.
See you later, OK?
The man who fears nothing is as powerful as he who is feared by everybody.
They're going to do it for us.
May I eat this cake?
Now I know why Tom hates me.
The scientific truth of evolution is so overwhelmingly established, that it is virtually impossible to refute.
I hate taking risks.
Tom looks downcast.
You need a haircut.
You'll do exactly as I say.
Do what you wish.
We can't promise anything.
Tom never knew that.
This is my home.
Tom has arrived in Boston.
Maybe Tom is dead.
She sat next to him.
We arrived safely in Boston.
The girl has a mouse.
I'll recommend it.
Don't love using words or language, but love by actions and truth.
Are you certain it was an accident?
You had it coming.
You had to make a choice.
It's completely illogical.
He had his tonsils removed because they would get inflamed too often.
We kept it secret.
I have two nieces.
Tom made an apology.
Tom has good eyes.
Why do I have to fight?
Ask them not to wait for me.
I'll be the one helping them, not you.
Have her do it.
Tom is turning blue.
There was a scornful note in his voice.
Today was so hard I think I'll sleep well tonight.
I checked it twice.
Being a reporter is hard work.
Someone's missing.
Tom would never hurt Mary.
Are you as hungry as I am?
I'm not in the mood.
I wish you'd call him.
Smart shopping requires careful planning.
Your body is nothing to be ashamed of.
Tom hurt his knee.
Tom fixed us a snack.
Tom retired at 65.
I like soccer best.
She has gone, but I still love her.
What else did you buy?
Let me know when you plan to come.
How can we help you?
Did he propose any solutions?
I don't know where I belong.
We found Tom's keys.
I see a plane flying over our house.
Where's the station?
Horses are ungulates.
You're not a good enough pilot to be able to land there.
May I speak to Tom?
If it were not for air and water, nothing could live.
I plowed the field.
This is powerful stuff.
I'm sorry, but the answer's no.
Anybody can read it.
Can I ride with you?
With your help, we'll catch Tom.
You don't know me, do you?
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
If you have a problem with that, we should talk about it.
Let's just eat here.
Let's buy this one.
I still need to renew my passport.
What a blessing it is that they did not come.
Everyone is still here.
Tom liked Mary as soon as he met her.
Words cannot describe how happy and blessed I am to have you.
You may not come in.
This pizza is disgusting!
I admire them.
It's a beautiful day.
Do you need anything?
I don't want to watch this video.
Tom knows there won't be much he'll be able to do about it.
Tom sidestepped the question.
That makes no sense.
It's 3:30.
I'm not saying that.
Was Tom a sailor?
They told me so.
That's why I came.
That sounds lovely.
I am giving you what you want.
I was disgusted.
Well, you were right.
You gave it to us.
I'll go to college.
Tom is very annoying.
I'm going to rest before I go out.
I had a lot of fun.
She looked excited.
I wouldn't make any sudden moves.
This is a Christmas present for you.
Where does he live, generally? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Don't forget to call her.
Tom and Mary are in agreement.
I eat here every day.
These don't match.
Can you contact her?
I want to prove to you that I'm not sick.
Tom likes to lounge around the house without any clothes on.
You should sue Tom.
That's part of the plan.
Tom offended Mary.
Tom is just a boy.
Mum and Dad aren't coming with me.
Quit picking on Tom.
I believe him.
I'm asking you both to try again.
Tom has no children.
I needed to blow off some steam.
That one's for me, too.
If she finds out, I'm screwed!
The ocean was calm.
Tom isn't going to give us any more trouble.
Look at me.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Why did you say yes?
How much do you make?
I know what Tom wants for his birthday.
She kept on crying.
Tom has done it to me again.
She has the measles.
I didn't know Tom and you were so close.
The young girl wants to be famous like Nicki Minaj.
I can't swim at all.
I had my camera stolen.
I couldn't stop crying.
Take a nap.
Meg always acts generously.
It's so nice to see you.
I'll call if I learn anything.
What is it that you liked about her?
Tom is going to hurt you.
Our plan has gone askew.
Give us something to eat.
I've had a busy week.
I'm staring again.
Tom took everything.
What is the story?
Tom has gone outside.
I wanted to share it.
Tom isn't going to catch Mary.
It doesn't seem so good.
We weren't scared.
Let's find another place.
I've had a couple of drinks.
Let me try another one.
I'm here to kill you.
Hey you! Up here!
I really do hate Tom.
I thought Tom would be too busy to help us.
I saw that.
She had a bad infection and her ovary swelled up.
Keep an eye on the door.
You're not in any trouble, Tom.
You'll never get it.
Why is Tom working late?
Sugared doughnuts are a weakness of mine.
He holds the rank of colonel.
She borrowed the ruler.
What Tom did was unbelievably idiotic.
Tom made a list of things he needed to buy.
I've rented a room in Boston for a month.
We were newlyweds.
That's very serious.
Tom knew why Mary slapped John.
Traffic in ivory is illegal.
You'll have three relationships before you meet your true soulmate.
Stop yelling in my ear.
I checked everywhere.
Tom is former FBI.
Do you blame us?
The strike lasted three days.
I'll be there Monday.
Tom was a nice guy.
Tom would understand.
Tom was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
We improved the quality.
Don't quit.
Let's try Tom first.
Where's Tom supposed to be?
She knows her limitations.
I didn't touch Tom.
Tom remained silent.
Hang on.
To know what is right and choose to ignore it is the act of a coward.
They kissed.
Has Tom been fed?
It won't happen to me.
Let's give her a minute.
We'll support any decision you make.
Why are you alone?
That's funny stuff.
There are turtles that are more than two centuries old.
Are there stars with other forms of life on them?
Tom took a sandwich out of the bag and started eating it.
That's the issue.
Since that time, crying has been forbidden.
Let's go to Tom's.
When he was about to pass, the Sphinx jumped in front of him.
I don't want you to miss out.
I'll be there at 2:30.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I'd rather not discuss her.
He's a nerd.
I think you've been spending too much time at work.
You weren't kidding.
What should we say?
I could die tomorrow.
That's what saved me.
I suggest you get started.
He's just kidding you.
You're disorganized.
I found the room empty.
Tom won the fight.
Don't believe everything you hear! Don't like everything you see! Don't say everything you know! Don't do everything you want!
I just got a text from him.
Tehran is in Iran.
You are always digging at me about my clothes.
It's not fair at all.
It wasn't that good.
Why are you resigning?
Nothing's going to happen to you if you do as you're told.
Why is my blood pressure high?
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
You always made my decisions for me.
They ran past Tom.
His behaviour is sometimes weird.
Tom cracked a joke.
Tom and Mary both have ponytails.
Not every lamp is magic.
Both of you be quiet.
The corrupt government officials fled the country.
I'm not my father.
It must be this way.
I don't have time to argue with you; I'm preparing the food.
Experience means nothing because you could do your thing badly for 35 years.
I have to get them home.
You should be happy for him.
People who are constantly copying others do it because they can't think for themselves.
How could things have happened this way?
I never doubted the outcome.
I'm sincere.
That can't be denied.
You made a great contribution.
Don't move from here.
Get him on the phone.
I think Tom is moody.
You're capable.
It's on the bottom shelf.
The sparrows are cheeping.
Tom and Mary aren't likely to ever see each other again.
It's odd.
Is everyone happy?
I kind of like Tom.
It is starting to sink in that we can't ignore nature.
Tom is a bit chubby.
I forgot your number.

They all just looked at him.
Who's on your list?
Don't touch my bag.

Tom didn't plan on talking to anyone.
I haven't explained it to Tom yet.
Let's all get back to work.
Tom sat back down.
I think you've been hanging out with Tom too much.
Nobody wants to play with him.
There's no way to translate it.
Does it make any difference?
I don't care if he has twenty girlfriends.
If anyone could get us what we need, it would be Tom.
Tom always yells when he's angry.
That's outrageous.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom appears confused.
Tom has lied to me in the past and I don't trust him.
He wants to meet you.
When will you start?
Of course not. That is quite impossible.
I've fully recovered.
My friend works at a supermarket.
You're prejudiced.
His abs were flat and toned.
It's my CD.
I think Tom is careless.
The medicine made me feel better.
I am no better than a beggar.
I didn't want this.
They have no money.
This is a special occasion.
It's no use. Tom can't be swayed.
That's Tom's girl.
Tom was misbehaving.
They're unconscious.

I'm just starving.
I don't deserve it.
Tom likes animals.
I'm sure Tom won't help us.
You're not a doctor.
I'll send you the schedule.
Now I know the reason that Tom hates me.
Let's not discuss it.
I'll set the alarm for seven o'clock.
They don't belong in there.
It was Tom's idea.
Do you want to keep dating them?
I just got an idea.
They organized a state army.

He is good at driving.
He dwells in the country.
I'm getting kicked out of school.
Who was this window broken by?

Do you think that bothered them?
Madison and Jayden are best friends.
I believe all that.
I believe I made myself clear.
He admired my new car.
Don't eat raw pork.
Roll up your right sleeve.
Let me tell you why you shouldn't do that.

Did you buy me these?
I'm keeping count.
Tom and Mary don't get along.
You've got a rash.
Many thanks for your help.

I like crossword puzzles.
Is this your phone?
What can I possibly do to help?
Call me later in the week.
Emotions are contagious.
Tom was the last one out.
Where would you like to meet?
Should we eat first?

This is kind of a special circumstance.
I'm taking it to Tom.
Maybe Tom doesn't need our help.
Did Tom change his opinion?
Pubic hair is curly.

Is that everything?
We weren't hiding.

Return immediately.

I can't hide you forever.
I missed my flight.
I met Tom at a club.
How soon do you think that'll be?
How shameful!
Let's see what it is.
I thought you knew.
I'm talking about you.
Just sign this.
What should we say to Tom now?
I don't have a boyfriend.
I believe I owe you an apology.
He was sent to prison.
I wish I were young.
The question is how we can raise as much money as we need.
I voted for her last year.
Tom wants to be rich.
He's renting the room.
I didn't want people to think I was hypocritical.
Should I call her?
Why did they do that?
Dan didn't even ask for my permission.
It rained all day.
I've got to go out.
Their wedding is tomorrow.

Am I early?

How are you coming in your work?
Why aren't you studying French?
They say that he will never return.

Tom won't talk to Mary and she won't talk to him.

I'm glad that worked.
I'm glad that I was able to help you last week.

I can only stay with you for just a few days.
She has to count every penny.
Tom came here from Boston.
Tom imitated Mary.
Do you remember us?
I'll know tomorrow.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I'll expect you soon.
I didn't know that was public knowledge.
We still haven't found them.
We're just going to talk.
Call me if there's any trouble.
I'll die without you.
They're wonderful.

What'll Tom do?
I was there that day.
Waste not a single grain of rice!
I can't even describe how much I've missed home, I've missed it so much.
The trees are green.
Who'll pay the rent?

What were Tom and Mary told?
Even if you go away, I'll still passionately love you.
Tom may be back soon.
Don't be afraid of speaking in public.
Tom is rarely late.
Do I look insane?
This word's stressed on the last syllable.
How is your family?

Who are they sending?
I don't go to church.
I've got some donuts.
Tom didn't pray.
Human greed is threatening the existence of many species.
I will miss you all.

Tom and Mary agree.
Tom got really mad.
We were talking about him.
Tom knows that I lied to him.
What a beauty!
Is that even a word?
I came to ask them a favor.
What time did you get there?
I don't work.
Tom danced.
None of them could understand.
That's a good start.
Who ruled this country?
Tom isn't in charge.
I think it would be better if I went alone.
No one ever comes here.
Everyone is master in his own house.
This watch is broken.
You're both wrong.
I've asked Tom to babysit for us on Monday night.
Tom taught me that.
Am I imagining this?
I'm saving this seat for him.
We survived!

Strap yourselves in.

I love your bag.
How did you manage to escape?
I couldn't live without you.
This isn't my key.
I'm going to be talking to Tom.
Gold doesn't rust.
Who are your enemies?

I think Tom is wise.
Do you have plans for this weekend?
We have to get out of here. The building's on fire.
Teenagers often wear strange clothes.
I think perhaps I can help him.

I can't believe that.
I stole it from her.
I'd like to pick you up now.
Do you know where we might find Tom?
I'll do the dishes, since you cooked.
This is a safe place.
It's all Greek to me.
He is morose today.
Tom is at a party.
Make me a sandwich.
Did you get a beer?
That's the last one.
They left last night.
What're your plans?
I remember something.

You've got to give it time.
Do you realize how much trouble you've caused?
I asked for him.
Stay quiet and be alert.
They come from Beijing.
Something very similar happened to me!
It's real.
There's something I have to say.
Go wash up.
I must go right away.
What time is it?
He took this photo.
I need to help Tom.
My life is ruined.

This is extremely hard for them.
I hesitate to ask her to help.
I have bad news for him.

That's how I got here.
We all stared at him.
Don't take more than five minutes.
He comes from England.
It's not over yet.
How many miles is it to Boston?
Tom was surprised.
It's me again, Tom.
You never gave them a chance.
Would you please shut the window?
Tom could've done it.
I did what I had to.
We don't lock doors.
That sounds like a scam.
What is Tom to you?
I already sold that.
Tom isn't the only one who knows how to do that.
Don't talk about him that way.
Where are Tom's keys?
She stepped on a mushroom.
I never touched Tom.
Make up your mind.
Let's not go there.
At least pretend you're happy to see me.
He always works hard.
We had a good day.
I'll go ask them.
Let me try another one.
He made a rude reply.
His daughter is able to recite a lot of poems.
We discuss many things.
More time is needed for the preparations.
I was very surprised.
Have you told Tom he's adopted?
I'm bored out of my mind.
What have you found?
We were traveling with a friend.
Sometimes it's a little hard to tell if Tom's happy or not.
"Is that okay?" "No, it's not okay."
How old are you now?
The kitchen door opened.
I don't think this is the best time for us to talk.
We only have a three hours left.
Tom won't back down.
I feel sick.
What would the prince like?
He was covered with mud.
Put it in the drawer.
I only work out to look good naked.
Eat your vegetables.
Has the house got a garden?
Who said I was ashamed?
How old was he in the first photo?
Was anyone surprised?
The light went out.
We're tempting fate.
Why would anyone want to kiss you?
There was nothing on the radio about the accident.
I'm a very busy man.
This is embarrassing.
You sound relieved.

Will it fit?

Please go right away.
I'll wait for him.

Let's do it your way.
Have you started yet?
Turn off the alarm.
The chairs are under the tree.
You've got to be joking.
She's insecure.
I'm selfish.
That's the reason.
You have everything.
Do you think you're modest?
