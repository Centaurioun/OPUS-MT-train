He pronounces English words in Spanish fashion because he is a Mexican.
What will it be of us?
Tom has been spying on me.
Move now.
I may not make it.
I'm an old friend.
Grandmother's ashes are in an urn at the temple.
I'm going to give you the book.
I think it's obvious.
This is my son, Tom.
Have you watched television tonight?
That's unreasonable.
I don't think I'd want to do that.
Don't leave me here alone.
Does he intend to become a doctor?
It rained last Monday.
Leave it to us.
How were you able to help?
The first airplane flew in 1903 for twelve seconds.
It became useless.
Tom warned Mary.
I appreciate your feedback.
I don't want to do it again.
As soon as he opened the door, he smelled something burning.
We arrived at the office on time.
We've got to find him.
Are we being charged with something?
It's a cold day in Cairo.
Stop beating on the door!
We are to preserve nature.
Why are you so busy?
We go to the seashore in the summer.
I asked who he was.
I can read.
Leave him with me.
Could we have a table in the non-smoking section?
I am from Tokyo, Japan.
You are no longer welcome here.
Is Tom back?
Are you still mad at Tom?
I accepted that a long time ago.
He will reach Hakodate tonight.
Tom is very particular about what he eats.
Tom lost the sight in one of his eyes in a traffic accident.
I struck the wall with my fist.
Tom evaded the question.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
The pond has dried up.
Tom was too shy to admit his feelings for Mary.
Does it have to be her?
I don't want to be alone all my life.
The city is asleep.
Tom is quite superficial.
Nothing is impossible for the gods.
I am going to study.
We were attacked.
Are you sure you want this one?
We walked a lot.
Tie the dog to a tree.
There is a large supermarket.
Tom lives alone in the woods.
I have to say goodnight to her.
I like to write here.
What do you want next?
Where can I get the medicine?
Tom lied about his age.
I want the same.
He was forced to go back because of the bad weather.
I was frightened when I saw that.
We'll be right here.
I knew I couldn't trust her.
I adore elephants.
You may see me there.
Is he Malaysian?
He will arrive on June 24.
This cathedral has a vaulted ceiling.
He divorced her after years of unhappiness.
You'd never survive.
That is the fastest train in the world.
I'm about to leave.
Prices will certainly go up.
Tom walked.
I'm from Norway.
Have you seen Tom try to start a fire?
They said they're happy.
Our high school decides to adopt a new teaching method.
I tasted the soup.
Do you enjoy it?
We have no choice but to kill.
Tom is an authority on jazz.
Who did it?
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
He works as a teacher, but actually he's a vampire.
Tom bought them each a camera.
Tom found a job.
I was real happy.
Do you speak Russian?
Call the cops.
Tom wants to learn.
I'm not a quitter.
I'm still around.
I was teaching Berber.
We were excited as we watched the game.
The police need someone to blame.
I have to at least try.
Mary is helping her father.
Rehearsals are going well.
I'm not an expert.
Did you find your passport?
I've returned.
He kept reading a book.
How high is it?
Skip the boring chapters.
Sami wasn't even there.
Tom got here an hour before Mary.
We're greedy.
It snows in the south during the winter.
Kill me with words!
Are you really OK?
Tom's screaming.
Do you sometimes drink red wine with fish?
He's back.
I wonder why Tom didn't help Mary.
Jack decided to cancel the reservations.
Tom says he isn't tired.
You should go talk to him.
She has a husband and two daughters.
Tom tried to swim across the river.
Tom didn't study at all.
Can you call back later?
Could you please repeat it slowly?
I want to speak French.
I still can't reach him.
I can't work any more.
He stood aloof.
It won't take long to read that book.
I only have thirty dollars left.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain and the man soon died.
They want to meet you.
You're not hurt, are you?
My parents hate him.
I crashed.
Tom did his best to rescue Mary.
Do you think I'm ugly?
He owns a yellow sports car.
You're jealous.
Now start singing.
She seemed to be very keen on music.
I'm ready to eat a horse.
I won't say anything.
Why didn't you bring it home?
I'm jealous of Tom.
I'm not sure there's a problem.
Where did you arrest them?
Can I leave a message?
You shouldn't eat this.
She may not have finished her homework.
I am busy today.
Do you know how to cook rice well?
You speak French very well.
Everyone is watching them.
I was a basketball coach at one time.
We are worried about grandpa and grandma.
Mary is agoraphobic.
What kind of teacher do you want to be?
It must have been stolen.
I think you're doing a great job.
Let me help you put on your coat.
Why not come and see me tomorrow?
I'm arguing with my friend.
She does not have much money.
I really like Tom.
I didn't speak to Tom.
Your lips are blue.
Tom tried to get me to wear a kilt.
You don't seem to be happy.
Why do you like Tom so much?
We played exceptionally well.
Sami worked there for six months.
I grew up in a poor family.
I just sold my car to Tom.
I hope Tom did what we told him to do.
My stomach is grumbling.
Why can't you be more like Tom?
The hare was overtaken by the tortoise.
I don't have any clean socks.
I'm trying to protect her.
Our work here is almost done.
Understanding jokes is subjective.
Mary dashed water in Tom's face.
Sami arrived.
Mary is engaged to Tom.
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
Tom and Mary were both surprised.
Please go back inside.
I won't give up, Tom.
All swans are white.
Tom is a numismatist.
You'll have to come here.
He ignored his father's advice.
You aren't able to swim, are you?
Would you still love me if I wasn't a werewolf?
I'm pretty weak right now.
This work demands specific abilities.
You must not play.
He knows how to interrogate people.
Saturday comes before Sunday.
Tom expected more.
Can you prove it?
Ramudu came.
Bring them along.
That store had to reduce their prices.
My head is exploding.
He's a musicologist.
I like men.
Ken offered Tom a gift.
Nobody asked Mary.
I haven't seen Tom yet today.
You look curious.
I want to be sure Tom is innocent.
Everything will be lost now.
Do you have dried salted beef?
I'm here looking for Tom.
The man awakens.
Hi, my name's Tom!
How are you today?
You can stay with us.
I think Tom hates us.
This word is difficult.
They are not all poor.
Napoleon Bonaparte was afraid of black cats.
Tom hates them.
He left from there.
Did you see him?
This is hard for me.
He reads before bedtime.
He speaks Japanese very well.
You have to believe me. I'm innocent!
Are you offering me a job?
I saw Michel last week. He'd been sick for a week.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Tom will turn up sooner or later.
Milk is a good beverage.
There are many people in the park.
You're still mad, aren't you?
So is this man your friend?
I don't blame her.
I am very happy for you!
Tom knew that Mary wasn't friendly.
Tom, I was just thinking about you.
Mike likes to play basketball.
She stabbed him with a knife.
Be kind to her.
It rang.
Light is no less necessary to plants than water.
Tom is very worried.
Tom smells horrible.
What are you doing this summer?
What's your last name, Tom?
They're now alone.
I don't know if I should tell him.
Come to Albania, we always make good coffee there.
She's asleep in her bedroom.
Something has happened to my car.
Tom lives near the dike.
I thought I was alone.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
We didn't get on the train.
This is very difficult for Tom.
I helped her clear the table.
I'll meet them in Boston.
Tom doesn't know anything about raising children.
I remember everything.
He remembers you.
Tom is a pianist.
You can tell them.
You're very beautiful.
Did you know that some foxes lived on this mountain?
I still don't like Tom.
To my disappointment, his letter didn't come.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
What will we have for dinner tonight?
Tom wouldn't lie to Mary.
Is the cafeteria open yet?
I advise you to give up drinking.
Why don't you stay there?
The money on the table isn't mine.
We're not going to risk that.
How long have you been in love with Tom?
Are you in much pain?
We pray for peace.
I've never met Tom's parents.
Tom is Mary's protege.
Tom isn't as rich as people think he is.
They swam against the stream.
You're particular.
You went to Boston, right?
Are you good at keeping secrets?
I can be there in 30 minutes.
She loves me. But I do not love her.
How many cops are there?
How much does Tom pay you?
He came to see me all the way from Pakistan.
Tom took everything from us.
What time do you usually get up?
He heard it.
One by one, the members told us about their strange experience.
You've got 24 hours.
I met him.
The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
I like grapes, but I can't eat too many of them.
But now I live in Tokyo.
Let's all get back to work.
I already know your secret.
That's not the problem.
I don't need a doctor.
We tried.
I was quite ignorant of the fact.
This language has many cases.
Right?
I have high hopes for her.
Stop beating around the bush and tell me what happened.
Shut up! You're talking too much.
Tell him that I'm sorry.
Tom showed us a picture of his mother.
The criminal was sent to the gallows.
Did you go out last night?
Bill will return next week.
I don't trust myself.
I spent all night working on this report.
Tom isn't mad at you anymore.
Why are you so smart?
Tom is a father now.
I'll call the police.
Don't leave me alone with them.
Did you pay for those shoes?
Nobody invests in my country.
The pot calls the kettle black!
Hey, are you crazy?
I'm Nana. I'm Hideki Yamauchi's daughter.
Tom began walking toward them.
I already went to the butcher's shop this morning.
Your hair is pretty.
I will be here from Monday to Thursday.
Tom was annoyed.
I'm not going to talk to him.
You cheated.
The debt crisis is not over.
I hiccup a lot.
He learned Russian when he was young.
Come with me, will you?
Women seem to like him for some reason.
We can't work under these conditions.
What time did you get up this morning?
I couldn't handle it.
Where are you headed for?
Tom is getting excited.
It would probably be a good idea.
Have you learned the number by heart?
She prefers French to German.
I don't like to sing in public.
His criticism of the Thai people doesn't jibe at all with my experience of them.
I never suggested that.
Mary and her friend took a selfie together.
Tom doesn't want to be like me.
Are you reading this book tonight?
She thought that I was a doctor.
Aren't you almost done here?
He is not himself today.
She cried as she read the letter.
He was looking at her.
Their campaigns are financed by the government.
He loves gardening.
Don't boast too much about that.
Some of them are red; others are brown.
The flowers smell so good.
He himself refused to talk to her.
I have a cousin who is a lawyer.
Perhaps I can help.
I never felt at ease in my father's company.
Natsume Soseki is one of the best writers in Japan.
You're doing very well.
Don't leave the room.
There is a good chance that he will win.
Try to go slower.
Don't forget to bring kitchen utensils such as knives and cooking pots.
I've seen them here before.
She really likes cake.
I'll fire her.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
Stop looking at that girl.
It is not going to rain this evening.
That's discouraging.
I didn't expect something like that.
Aren't you doing anything?
Well, take it.
He doesn't have a job. He's retired.
Tom lives near here.
I'm not going to waste time.
You're disloyal.
Arabic is a very important language.
Tom wants vengeance.
I have been busier than the two boys.
Tom doesn't know what's been happening here.
The cat is on the table.
Would you pass the salt, please?
The girl let the bird loose.
Tom seems apprehensive.
Tom will probably still be mad.
I'm proud to be a Canadian.
We went shopping in Shibuya yesterday.
He can't walk any more.
He lost his umbrella again.
Tom's covering something with his right hand.
I can't come out and play today.
I need to talk to you tonight.
We'll need more than that.
Tom will be here in less than an hour.
How often do you visit Boston?
Keep her away from me.
Don't forget to take an umbrella.
Tom is one of my best students.
Why didn't you bring your hat today?
Eat more protein.
Tom says he hopes that Mary does that.
He watched the girls playing tennis.
She is Russian.
It looks like I made a lot of mistakes.
This is irregular.
I told him what you did.
It was painful.
I don't deserve your love.
Tom was in Boston all weekend.
Where are Tom's parents?
Sami learned Arabic in Cairo.
Where did you swindle them?
I told her I agreed with her.
I can take this to him.
Tom announced that he was quitting football.
When exactly did you get here?
Tom wouldn't negotiate.
He is a farmer.
It looks like you changed the whole room.
Am I the only one that feels this way?
I saw a very interesting documentary yesterday.
I need an ambulance.
I'm as tall as you.
It is Monday today.
Someone grabbed me from behind.
I don't believe that.
I admire your determination.
Tell them I had to leave.
Why aren't you in Boston?
The pilots tested their guns.
Tom sings in a choir.
I'd be worried if I were you.
I didn't find Tom.
Can I join the team?
Where was the body found?
Tom has trouble waking up on time.
Mary knows many things.
I'm already doing something about it.
Have you ever seen Tom cry?
Why do you walk when you have a car?
What was Tom's reply?
So, what would you do?
Why did you come back from Boston?
I wish I had a lot more money.
Look at that smoke. That building must be on fire.
I didn't want to live in Boston.
Who said that to you?
We have branches everywhere.
You're my friend.
He is good at basketball.
In that village only one family remains.
How much candy did you buy?
I think that Shintaro speaks English well.
I wrote it for her.
I forgot to turn off the TV.
You hugged Mary.
Tom shot the clay pigeon.
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
When did you see them?
How far is it from here to the sea?
Has Tom's French improved?
I wanted you to see it.
Are you the one who asked Tom to help?
I just need to find out why.
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary can.
Why did you decide not to go to Australia?
Almost nobody is unemployed now.
I left the money at his disposal.
Does someone here know how to do this?
In Japan, it's now 3:00 a.m.
This is my email address.
I didn't expect anything.
I'll be in my office.
The pizza's ready.
Fresh air is blowing in.
Tom is not to blame.
Tom said that I looked annoyed.
After you.
Are they American?
Tom hates Mary's cooking.
She gave an apple to Tom.
I don't know which child is yours.
Come quickly.
I'm very proud of the job I chose myself.
You can't control me.
There is a group of people who don't agree.
You're really dirty.
She has done it.
I'm too busy to see her.
Don't say anything.
But she's innocent!
Would you explain that chart to me?
Miss, are there any available rooms for tonight?
I had to help him.
Tom should have no regrets.
They were the nightmare of the elderly.
Mary isn't my girlfriend. She's just a friend.
Her long hair was completely wet.
You have not seen him.
You are very welcome.
We must achieve our aim at any price.
I think I should've helped her.
Do you remember what you said?
Please remind me of the time of the meeting.
Have you ever visited Rome?
We were disappointed.
Tom said he needed some cash.
I'm for that.
I'm just trying to find her.
I know how it is written.
Do I look tired?
The trouble is that your plan would be too expensive to carry out.
He rarely stays home on Sunday.
You won't be ready.
I like bread more than rice.
What do you plan to do this summer?
Tom spends most of his free time reading comics.
We need rain.
Are you my cousin?
We've done a lot.
I think Tom and Mary are overemotional.
I wrote that last Monday evening.
I think we'd better inform Tom.
We'd still like to speak with Tom.
"Are you going to put this on Kongregate?" "Yes, there is a two-week period where the game will only be available on Armor Games since they're sponsoring it, but I will upload it to Kongregate after that."
We went to the botanical garden.
Since I was tired, I went to bed.
Seoul is the capital of South Korea.
Are you coming?
Is this your first visit?
I attend a lot of events.
Now, where did you come from?
Is that correct?
Can you speak Shanghainese?
We should be there helping them.
Dan and Linda spent the summer together.
Is it OK if I stay here?
I didn't kill him.
Thanks for being on time.
Are you going to talk to them?
The accent of this word is on the second syllable.
I'm just waiting for Tom.
The reasons for our failure are as follows.
Did you remember to go to the library?
Size does not matter.
He arrived an hour late, which annoyed me very much.
Tom writes well.
He is afraid of the dog.
Tom has a very stressful job.
Why is Tom upset?
She has no less than ten children.
I need a bigger chair.
I don't want Tom to get sick.
How many presents do the newlyweds get?
They're not soldiers.
Your cat is fat.
Alkalis neutralize acids.
Can you re-do it for me?
They crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
It's been 10 days since my boyfriend went to jail.
Wake her up.
I chose to teach Berber.
Tom followed my advice.
They're in the well.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom couldn't sing the high notes.
We think it is very dangerous that you're climbing the mountain alone.
Tom finally confessed.
We are happy.
I'll hurry.
I met her in London for the first time.
His explanation is unconvincing.
You are not eating anything.
I was your age once.
Do you study English?
A car hit Tom.
Blame me for everything.
I slipped and fell down the stairs.
We learned French.
Tom won't be wearing a tie.
He is quite athletic.
I have a friend who went to school with Tom.
They didn't find it.
They're jittery.
Tom was reading the newspaper.
What time are you used to going to bed?
Why don't you go help them?
I asked Tom about his job.
What did he do today?
The tree is sick.
All I ate yesterday was one apple.
Tom denied knowing anything about it.
They know what they want to see.
Let's go shoplift from the supermarket.
She died childless.
I have just one thing to ask of you.
Why are you embarrassed?
Tom probably isn't hungry yet.
Objection!
What do you want to do for work?
We know you didn't kill her.
He ordered a cup of tea.
It's not so cheap.
He says he will not give up smoking.
What do you want?
They're dreadful.
It's still there.
One of the tigers has escaped from the zoo.
Have you seen Tom this morning?
I don't want to live with you.
Everybody is focused.
He was sick, so he couldn't come.
She was happy with the new dress.
The two streets run parallel to one another.
It's fairly difficult to do that.
She gets prettier day by day.
The last time I saw Tom he was wearing a tuxedo.
You're busy today, aren't you?
You should go home.
Am I fat?
We hope Tom doesn't do that.
You absolutely must watch it.
She spends a lot of money on shoes.
What's your favorite Australian folk song?
I really can't remember people's names, but I don't forget faces.
Is there a restaurant in the hotel?
Tom took his jacket off.
Give it to me now.
What did you use your camera for?
You may think that animals can sleep in any position.
Try and do that.
He kissed me on the cheek.
It is wicked of you to do such things.
Who do you think helped him?
I've missed travelling so much.
We have to wear shoes.
Tom isn't very spontaneous, is he?
We'd better think of something.
Tom shut the trunk.
Something frightened Tom.
Tom is from here, isn't he?
The movements of this robot are awkward.
My friend has a large family.
Can you lower the price?
She confused a cup of tea with a bottle of vodka.
I like my steak medium.
Tom didn't see me.
It's nothing.
I asked Nancy to stay at home.
I will come tomorrow.
I'm methodical.
Don't tease him.
Last year I had five cars.
The south of Italy is called the Mezzogiorno.
Tom thinks I'm jealous.
Tom and Mary have done their homework.
You should give Tom some space.
Sumatra is an island.
I am learning English with the idea of going to America.
You never asked why.
Now the only ones I really like are the Italian sisters, but they won't win.
Learning a foreign language requires perseverance.
Will you forgive me?
Why does he look grumpy?
I must go home now.
I feel unwell.
I hope this is worth it.
Everything okay?
Tom is my age, or maybe a little younger.
Earth is our oasis in space.
Will you tell us a story?
Between you and me, I don't like our new team captain.
I see him from time to time.
I forgot all about you.
You aren't rich.
I think I know how to find them.
Tom told me you were married.
What's the price of this?
You are just a whore.
She is aggressive.
Who believes that?
I'd leave a message.
You know who he is.
Do you know what vivisection is?
Can't we tell him about it?
Have you seen them on stage?
Do you have feelings for Tom?
Don't forget your money.
Tom said he knew you.
I have plans tonight.
Spain is called "Espanya" in Catalan.
Thanks for staying with her.
My major is comparative religion.
Tom always liked you.
You've already won.
Tell him this is urgent.
Many young Japanese travel overseas these days.
Tom didn't have a girlfriend.
She lives in a gated community.
Tom still has opportunities.
I bought Tom a laptop.
Were they here?
Bad people aren't born bad.
Did you have fun in Boston?
I always take a bath before going to bed.
My studies keep me pretty busy.
Aoi dances very well.
Tom decided to take legal action.
We're ready.
I hope that you are not angry.
Try not to disturb me.
I am a stranger here.
I didn't like Tom's suggestion.
Imagine yourself on a mountaintop.
I do hope that it won't rain tomorrow.
The red box contains a green cube.
I wanted to kill her.
Where did you repair them?
Don't you work in the cafeteria?
You'll meet her.
This country has a rich history.
I'm not going to make any comment about this.
You have to focus.
Nothing is wrong.
I warned Tom.
Tom is Mary's husband's best friend.
He was accused of money-laundering.
That made Theodore Roosevelt angry.
I want to go to New York.
Tom sat down and read the paper.
Excuse me, I have a request.
I miss Italy.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
Tom has spotted us.
Tom wouldn't do that.
That should be easy.
Don't drink that.
Well, where do I begin?
Please, open your mouth!
I was willing to do that.
He said he wouldn't dance.
Tom treats me like a child.
She was a bit late.
I didn't have time to eat breakfast this morning.
It will cost around 10,000 yen.
Get him away from here.
He lives inside an apple.
I'm convinced Tom isn't guilty.
What were you drinking?
Do you like Japanese or English?
Making money is his main purpose in life.
You're supposed to take your shoes off at the door.
Were you with my father today?
Tom and Mary told John that they didn't want to study French.
He is a bit like his father.
What's your favorite place to eat in Boston?
Tom may need a new house.
The flowers in his garden have withered.
Tom is disloyal.
You will need an armed escort.
Tom was taken into custody.
Sing!
It's wrong, Tom.
Do you want them there?
I'll tell you a story.
You're sarcastic.
Tom is still very upset.
The peace negotiations will start this week.
I'm not satisfied with the quality of your work.
I read those messages in Berber.
We're flabbergasted.
What do you want to talk about?
You deserve the prize.
You are the backing group.
Tom scares me.
Tom doesn't speak French as fluently as you.
What's happened to us?
I'm not being defensive.
I love Occitan.
We shall all die some day.
We have a big supermarket.
You're not interrupting anything.
Did you know them personally?
I am happy to hear your voice.
I wish I had more energy.
What a pleasure!
Tom just wants something to eat.
Have you caught that Unicorn yet?
I study mathematics.
Put the ladder against the wall.
What about?
Tom has to change his plan.
It is raining cats and dogs.
Laurie knows how to swim.
She is off duty tonight.
You are going to sleep.
They're upstairs.
I don't like salad.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Where's your watch?
I think we're neighbors.
I'm not a coward.
Tom is suspended.
You've got my personal guarantee.
I think it's safe.
I can hear you loud and clear.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
You needed space, didn't you?
Here is the map.
The death of his father filled him with sorrow.
He has expensive tastes.
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Did you ever hear Tom threaten Mary?
Give me the same, please.
Where are they taking you?
You are late.
I have nothing to say to him.
Love will find a way.
Tell him where we've gone.
Tom put it in the box.
Come in.
Unfortunately, that's not an option.
He makes my life a living hell.
I never lie.
What time did you get to bed last night?
You really need a woman.
I've never gotten on a plane yet.
I'd rather not know.
I read your report.
I've heard no complaints from Tom.
I passed on the job to him.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
There is no one like you.
To make matters worse, he isn't even conscious of annoying his neighbors.
Why not make it official?
Give me the key.
I saw him beating the animal.
She shook her head.
I'm happy to see you again.

I've never told anyone that.
You look wonderful.

The clouds hid the sun.
I'm absolutely certain you're wrong about that.
Tom set the timer.
Tom knows that I don't often win.
We're quite comfortable.
Please give me some salt.
I don't deserve to live.
You lost.

Can you Braille?
Now he has nothing to live for.
We know it.
Where are you going to spend the vacation?
What I meant to say was that you shouldn't do that.
He's crazy about you.
Have you met any Canadians here in Boston?
Tom wanted to dye his hair.
I don't miss Tom.
She's at the hotel now.
Why should Tom visit Boston?
I'm here on vacation.
I answered.
Has Tom already signed the contract?
I'm saving it.
Tom must be home.
I'm afraid of heights.
He is not a child.
This is very useful.
I wasn't confident at all.
I don't want to look weak.
You didn't have to get off so early.
Could you ask Tom to call Mary?
Keep away from us.
I'm very pleased with it.
This is an apple, too.
For a delirious word there is no answer.
The loss was a disappointment.
Invite your friend for dinner.
