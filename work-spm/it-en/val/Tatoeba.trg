I really want Tom to like me.
We buy bread.
You had better go in person.
We built it.
I'm certain Tom will want to speak with you.
They are urchins.
Life is full of confusing things.
Tom should know that.

How much does it cost to get in?

She does this every single time.
You won.
I contributed.
As far as modern writing is concerned, it is rarely rewarding to translate it, although it might be easy. Translation is very much like copying paintings.

Yesterday, he told me the truth.
I know Tom quite well.
You're making us nervous.
She sees nothing wrong with it.
Tom will probably be here this afternoon.
I'm not frustrated at all.

Tom is important.
Don't forget your gloves. It's cold.
I was demanding.
We swam in the lake.
Tom didn't feel like talking.

That was really beautiful.
Can you write it for me?
Let's have a look.
Tom is your son's best friend, isn't he?
Tom could be a cop.
He died a few days later.
He tries to make a good text for the audience.

We pay you well.
You should have accepted her advice.
You know so much about Tom.
I replied to you.
Remember that you are mortal.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Reduce the size of your portions.
Where did you exorcize them?
Don't forget them.
It's very difficult to explain.
Where did he park his car?
Check with her.
How much sugar did you buy?
Everyone asks us that.
I'm being good with you this morning.
Tom remained outside.
Tom was trying to be funny.
I should tell them.

Have some enthusiasm for your job.
You have to help them.
It is kind of you to help me.
I quickly adapted myself to my new school.
Tom looked offended.
I am listening to a song.
I can't work with you.

We can help you.

She's married to a dentist.
This is perfectly normal.
I like your sweater.
I won't judge you.
You will soon get used to eating Japanese food.
Do you study French at school?
I couldn't find them anywhere.
You're faithful.
Your idea is wrong.
I'm good with children.
Who are the responsible people?
I've tried to contact him.
We were just having fun.
I feel a pain here.
I'm much heavier than you.
Do you like Asians?
Here we go.
I'll be back within an hour.
I just needed a little encouragement.
I used to be very fat.
Did you really talk to him?
My grandfather comes from Osaka.
What should I tell her?
Did you hear that sound?
I know this is hard.
I know what happened to them.
Last Tuesday I visited the United States.
Finish the story.
I was amazed at the boy's intelligence.
What are the implications of Medea's words?
He refused my invitation.
Why don't you ask Fadil?
Who do you talk to?
So tasty!

I need a hotel for tonight.
He is busy with affairs of state.
I beg you, give me a bottle!
He said he liked the party.
I never got to meet him.
Tom opened the door for Mary.
Good morning, my sweet dog.
Where are my cigarettes?
I shouldn't have told you anything.
He couldn't stop laughing.
I read the story three times.
The troubles of others are our own.
I think Tom won't be embarrassed.
The lack of money is the root of all evil.
Which one was Tom?
He still has no experience for this job.
I don't plan to vote at the upcoming election.
Tom isn't qualified to do that.
What did they say to you?
Poor Pinocchio! He even tried to tear his hair, but as it was only painted on his wooden head, he could not even pull it.
Tom wasn't in the basement.
I gave Tom a sedative.
Tom has lived here for three years.
I still haven't found him.
I should give him a call.
Why are you carrying a baseball bat?
What trips are you planning?
I really love him.
I am a masochist.
It seemed appropriate.
I didn't know what to say.
She fell on her knees while crossing the street.
I think we should pay Tom more.
I don't know her address.
Who told her to do that?
I'm just lazy.
He did all he could to protect his son.
What will be done?
Where's Tom tonight?
It's my job to protect them.
We live on the planet Earth.
You always say that.
You won't get anything by shouting.
Did you give it to him?
More often than not, he is late for school.
What do you want to eat tomorrow?
Now, wait a second.
I hate elevators.
Tom seems terribly distraught, doesn't he?
I think I've done well.
Would you like to drink tea or coffee?
I have an important message for Tom.
Did you go to the doctor?
Please shut the door.
I'd appreciate your help.
There's nothing else you can do.
You're a human.
I'm awake now.
Where did Tom learn to dance?
I didn't expect this from you.
Mary remembers you.
I can't wait here like this.
Should we wait here for them?
I know a little French.
Be home by half past six.
Neither Tom nor Mary has visited Australia.
I can only speak English.
I told her you were busy.
You have red wine.
Leave it up to Tom.
Did he tell you what to do?
We'll miss you.
Halloween is just around the corner.
I am not afraid.
Did you spend the entire morning with Tom?
I have no comment.
Only a few understood what he said.
She's young and beautiful.
I've only been there once.
Do you like my T-shirt?
Do you three ever go to Boston together?
I'm currently working at the school as a teacher.

Contact me tomorrow.
I want them to do it alone.
Tom and Mary were right.
We can't solve this problem.
Does anybody here know them?
The air-conditioning in the library is too strong.
Don't let me down.
I can't trust you.
To explain the risks is very important.
I cannot forget Taninna's face.

Don't bother.
Why didn't you tell him this?
I suggest you study French.
