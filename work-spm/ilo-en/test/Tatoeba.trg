He was weak from the loss of blood.
Who are those young ladies?
We took a vote.
Don't play with that key!
I eat alone.
I wrote the book.
What made you change your mind?
I like baseball.
I envy you.
Do you want to end up like Tom?
I never liked Christmas.
Love is better than sex.
Tom left me the keys.
Pick me up at 2:30.
We caught him trying to go out of his room.
She left France for America.
Do you understand everything?
Tom sympathized.
Despite the importance of sleep, its purpose is a mystery.
We need this.
I'm very glad to see you.
I told you he was a coward.
I'm off beer.
I'm winning.
You were late for work.
I didn't know you cared.
Should we wait for Tom here?
I have to go to sleep.
I know.
She's coming!
I won't tell anyone about this.
Don't you recognize them?
Do you think Tom would like this?
He's shit-faced.
You may do whatever you want to do.
Love your neighbour.
You must be new here.
You said so yourself.
I'm not saying this to hurt you, but it is the truth.
Tom could beat anybody.
Do cats dream?
Nobody can stop me.
Tom is often wrong.
At the age of six he had learned to use the typewriter and told the teacher that he did not need to learn to write by hand.
I don't have as much money as you think.
Your plan is sure to succeed.
Tom closed his eyes and thought about Mary.
Do you know the answer?
Are you tired?
Tom swam.
Are they done already?
I think she's in love with me. What should I do?
Poor old Tom.
Tom volunteers.
Happy birthday, Muiriel!
We need a victory.
Who don't you know here?
It may rain tomorrow, but we are going in any case.
Flowers attract bees.
You must do it yourself.
Tessa is a good violinist.
They call him Jim.
Oww! Oww! Oww! The bath water is too hot.
Most people think I'm crazy.
You may choose whichever you want.
Save Tom.
Forget it.
I don't like Christmas any more.
Cats are smart.
Keep on working while I'm away.
Don't worry. It's perfectly safe.
I'm sure that was the reason.
Tom has sex with Mary.
Let's talk about what to do with the stranger.
I don't work for them anymore.
The festival will be held in the garden, unless it rains.
I'm looking for a house.
Cats have nine lives.
You must be thrilled.
I have a debt to pay.
Everything that Tom said is true.
How are you?
How's that business going?
We need to stop Tom before he hurts himself.
Have any of you ever seen something like this before?
I'm sure Tom will understand.
We celebrated his birthday.
I ate only bananas.
I didn't believe you.
I love you.
She is not a student.
We should get out of here now.
Who'll be there?
She painted the walls white.
Someone cut the rope.
If we have not covered all the questions you asked, please inform us.
She tore a hole in her blouse.
I run ten kilometers daily.
Why did you tell Tom Mary was ugly?
I have to go to sleep.
Are you sad?
Are you married?
It being Sunday, I got up late in the morning.
How's everything at home?
Do you have brothers and sisters?
I've got to be careful.
Who's thirsty?
Dan spent the night having sex with Linda.
Tom isn't finished.
I'm blind, not deaf.
Where do I put my bags?
We're teasing.
She did not agree.
My name is Jack.
She was always different from other children.
You chicken out again, you coward?
Tom gave Mary the money she needed to pay off her debts.
Do you remember who I am?
If it never happened to you, you're a virgin.
Do you want coffee?
Release Tom.
Do you eat meat?
With one swift kick, the door busted down!
I couldn't take my eyes off of you from the minute I entered this room.
He's now studying.
Mary did not climax when she and Tom had their first sexual intercourse.
Please go away and stop annoying me.
Tom has to give Mary another chance.
It's already time to go home.
Blood circulates through the body.
Do you think you could be a cop?
Maybe you should leave me alone.
That was why he entered the university.
You shouldn't judge a person by his appearance.
You're not going to win.
Who talked?
We're undressing.
I don't know anything about your job.
God help us.
The death penalty should be abolished.
The latest issue of the magazine will come out next Monday.
What is it for?
Who farted?
What is a UFO?
I'm bored to death.
I try to keep my promises.
How do we find Tom?
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
Come back, OK?
I love movies with happy endings.
It's a fish.
Her name's Irina.
Our teacher gives us a lot of homework.
I feel ashamed.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but I am truly mesmerized by your beauty.
We need to help Tom.
She used to live in Tel Aviv.
Don't worry, be happy!
Life has become very difficult.
I will be back soon.
We know enough.
Could you turn off the TV?
Man learned early to use tools.
He talked to me every day.
To be successful, you have to establish a good plan.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the seven days of the week.
I went fishing.
Why does it take them so long to set up my internet connection?
Mary did not bleed in her first sexual intercourse with Tom.
I held the door open.
I'm sure it's just temporary.
They called him a coward.
Where have you been?
I don't care how much it costs.
Whose pen is this?
I've never been to Paris.
He would be very glad to hear the news.
Tom is my mentor.
He did not decide to be a writer until he was thirty.
I received a letter from one of my friends in Japan.
Tom is early again.
Tom wasn't clear.
I was forced to lie.
What time is it?
I feel ashamed.
Congratulations!
"Why are you doing this?" "Why not?"
Do good to those who hate you.
We moved the project to a new server.
Tom was killed by lightning.
Do you want to try it?
We need to hurry.
Come along.
It is not far to Paris.
Do you like to travel?
We need to find Tom right away.
I shouldn't have lied to you.
I have already finished reading this book.
You could've written.
I don't want to go to school.
We've already started.
I have my own way of solving it.
This isn't an easy decision.
This beer is bitter.
This is not ours.
Mr Briggs is no doctor, he is a butcher.
I drink coffee.
They live nearby.
Tom teaches.
Let's try to change the system.
Every day we use many things which Edison invented.
We're starved.
He was so hungry that he didn't hesitate to eat everything on the plate.
Don't you dare answer that.
I wonder why everybody left so early.
Get out.
Tom touched my shoulder.
We're not cowards.
Should we wait for Tom here?
Use this.
I hate terrorist organizations.
I had my fingers caught in the door.
Happy New Year!
I drink coffee.
Are you coming to the party tonight?
He wanted to be respected by everybody.
I don't lie.
It's not my fault.
Stop smoking.
I love to cook.
I considered him a friend.
Summers are very hot in Kyoto.
We need rain.
Hurry up.
We'd better get inside.
Tom has a large dick.
What's my room number?
He has worked for the welfare of his people for 30 years.
Tom has a small penis.
I paid in advance.
I'm so fat.
Goodnight!
He whistled as he walked.
What's the reading on the blood pressure monitor?
Tom yelled.
Call your mom and tell her you'll be late.
You're not one of us.
I really need to talk to you privately.
It's illegal to park your car here.
Where are our friends?
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
I sold it this afternoon.
Good morning, baby! Did you sleep well?
It is nice to see you again.
I'm bored.
She always arrived too early.
They quarreled.
What do you think caused this?
I have a girlfriend.
The car crashed into the wall.
The password is "Muiriel."
It being Sunday, I didn't get up early.
Stop Tom.
Tom and Mary had consensual sex.
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
The chicken the waiter brought to the table was still raw.
That's my cat.
It's Monday.
Of course yes!
I'm three years younger than you.
I'll never run away again.
Which language do you like better, Kannada or Telugu?
I feel blue.
He owns this land.
How strange!
If you had a time machine, where would you go?
We'll walk.
I haven't read this book.
Are you on Facebook?
We're undressing.
When do we go?
It was raining and the game was called off.
Were there any witnesses?
Thank you very much!
They incited him to commit the crime.
Save Tom.
Who else is down there?
She's a bride.
He doesn't do stupid things like that.
What are you reading?
Terrorists were everywhere.
He is proud of being a musician.
I'm tired of watching TV.
I have to go to sleep.
Come in.
It's been a week now since Tom changed his underpants.
I returned to Boston on October 20th.
She looked ghostly.
I'd like to buy a Picasso.
We know what to do.
Who surrendered?
Are there any risks?
Don't you just hate this kind of movie?
I was happy to know he was well.
Aren't you a very kind man?
Tom explained everything to Mary.
Spiders scare me.
I'm smarter than you.
We need more than ten cases of beer for our party.
Tom will agree with me.
You're a coward!
Listen to me!
I can't live without a TV.
None of us did what Tom wanted us to do.
You'd better not go.
All we need is a little patience.
Cats hate water.
He walked barefoot.
I'm going there. No one can stop me.
Do you still need my help?
I want to leave Paris.
We need rain.
Leave me alone!
I'm sad for everyone concerned.
What do you think of the new teacher?
He ordered them to release the prisoner.
I feel blue.
I can't live without you.
Tom wasn't complaining.
I need to go to the toilet.
May I borrow your dictionary?
You run very fast.
I own this place.
Would you please sign our petition?
He spoke slowly enough for everyone to understand.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
Do you have Bud Light?
None of us had any idea what was going to happen.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom vanished.
Tom isn't busy now.
Let's go!
They're always careful.
Are you for or against his idea?
You have to go.
The rice we harvested is bountiful.
Everyone seems to be busy but me.
We speak French.
The towel is wet.
I thought you'd love it.
Do you know something about this?
Are you the only one who has a key to this door?
The blue bicycle is new.
Catch Tom.
You're a good doctor.
Close that door!
That won't happen.
You lacked confidence in yourself.
Beliefs are a product of our imagination.
I pay Tom well.
Cats catch mice.
Listen.
You have a job to do.
They're not going to catch us.
He was laughed at by everybody.
He died when he was scarcely thirty.
He sent a card to Mary.
I know your father.
You look pale.
He satisfied his hunger with a sandwich and milk.
Don't be afraid of speaking in public.
Tom wants to help out.
I told Tom he was a coward.
You have chosen the best.
I would like to place an order for the following.
We've been discovered.
What is it for?
This clock is electric.
Does Tom really want me to do this?
It was pretty dark.
I'm talking.
I couldn't fix it.
What does it mean to have an educated mind in the 21st century?
They drank coffee.
Tom has a small dick.
Tom is estimating how much money he'll need to finish the house.
One language is never enough.
Have I made the right decision?
Please hurry.
We've barely begun.
The kid is peeing.
I owe you thirty dollars.
With a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
You made a fool of yourself.
I know Tom doesn't want to be there.
They showed me a lot of beautiful photos.
I have no regrets.
Tom is the tallest guy in his class.
It has to be done a different way.
Yes.
Tell me when you will call me.
How did her son die?
He will come this afternoon.
She has known him for a long time.
Who has been in my room?
What does this word mean?
Finding a good place to live isn't easy.
Tell Tom to be careful.
You'll never guess what Tom did.
Are you sure this is where Tom lives?
I had a meal.
Your plan is a good one, but mine is a better one.
Water is life.
Why are you telling me all of this?
I miss my friends.
What time are you going to leave for London?
I watched TV this morning.
Did you mean this?
Japan relies on Arab countries for oil.
Tom didn't understand a word Mary said.
How large is your family?
Whose house is this?
Tom has it made.
You were my favorite.
Tom was born in October.
Are they speaking English?
Come here at once.
He called his mother up from the airport.
I opened the door slowly.
We have a lot of things to consider.
I had an operation last summer.
Let me pay.
Tom is unable to work this week.
Do you want to get drunk?
This is a wooden comb.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
That's pretty amazing.
My name is Tom.
I paid for them.
I am very tired.
Tom sang some old songs.
Cats dislike being wet.
Tom is my best friend.
All that glitters is not gold.
We celebrate November 28 as Tatoeba day because it is the day when Turkish, Esperanto and Greek were added.
Tom didn't think the rain would last so long.
The band sounds different this time.
Do you believe in ghosts?
He is not interested in art at all.
My mother wouldn't stop crying.
I think we'll all feel better once we get a little sleep.
I agree to your plan.
I don't lie.
You look very beautiful.
How much is it?
I could read between the lines.
Life is like a journey.
Don't you like this?
Do you speak English?
Forgive Tom.
She adores cats.
I want to go somewhere quiet.
That's a tree.
How many Philippine presidents were there until Benigno Simeon Aquino III?
How many times have you gone?
Don't smoke. Smoking can shorten your penis.
I hope to see you again.
You don't have to tell me your name.
I can't blame you.
A man's penis controls him.
Shouldn't we stop this?
Yes, but that?
Jesus was born of Mary.
He has a large family to provide for.
Did you miss me?
The blanket is still wet.
You're single, right?
Tom wasn't concentrating.
They're never happy.
Now the school has a boy from England.
Drinking beer refreshes me.
I bought an mp3 copy of Debussy's "Clair de Lune" in an online music store.
What would you do if you were in my place?
Tom survived.
"Where's your cousin?" "She's just left."
Do you study English?
I like dogs.
Even the hard-hearted can be moved to tears.
Lost in thought, I missed my stop.
What can I do about this?
They won't know.
We have a dog.
Would the last one out please close the door?
I will be back soon.
Do you think you could take me there?
They made fun of him.
I have been to the airport to see my father off.
They're still young.
I'm going to go there with Tom.
He caught them stealing apples.
I don't want to fail my exams.
What he lacks is courage.
I don't believe this.
Submit your homework on Monday.
We've been looking.
The magazine is issued twice a month.
They know I know.
I'd like to apologise on behalf of my son.
Perhaps it will rain tomorrow.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Can you get Tom to come to my party?
I go there every year.
There is a church near my house.
That's shit!
He will be punished.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
You won't be ready.
Some of the ingredients are harmful, especially if you are pregnant.
What are you trying to decide?
Don't you believe in miracles?
Sex is pleasurable.
What do you want to know about Turkey?
You all look so busy.
I admire Tom a lot.
Hit Tom.
Tom heard the noise.
Where did Tom go?
I became Tom's friend.
I'll never see Tom again.
I waited for my husband till after midnight.
She's a patient woman.
Tom closed one eye.
It was a controversial decision.
I could feel the house shaking.
Tom and Mary don't want us here.
Tom might go to Boston to look for a job.
Did you know that Tom was a friend of Mary's?
Have you got a car?
This is a horse.
How many hours have you been studying?
I'm gonna shoot him.
That is not art. That is a vagina dentata.
On my way to school each day, I generally see many dogs and cats.
Tom is scared to talk to Mary.
I thought I was never going to see Tom again.
Don't they drive you mad?
I wish to go to Hawaii.
Tom wasn't celebrating.
That's not the reason.
A cat scratched me.
I was with friends all last night.
The enemy blew up the bridge.
Tell me all about your plan.
The terrorists released the hostages.
Why haven't they shown up yet?
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.
Do you have children?
Do you smoke?
I have a feeling you'll get the job.
I'm looking for a house.
You always lie to me.
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
Who knows?
Tom should go home.
Congress approved the resolution in October.
Is it yours?
Do you know why she couldn't come?
In the past it was thought the world was flat.
I'm used to staying up late at night.
You can add sentences you don't know how to translate.
You are new students.
Don't worry. It's not important.
I took shelter under my friend's umbrella.
Who does Toshio like?
Your penis is big.
Let's relax.
Let's try!
When the cat is away, the mice will play.
He is more lucky than clever.
I'm kidding.
Unless it rains, I will go, too.
How embarrassing!
We need to call the police.
He crossed the Pacific Ocean in thirty days.
We need a car.
I've done nothing.
I got on the wrong bus.
We've already started.
Come back here, you coward.
I will give up drinking at any cost.
Nobody understands me.
Tom was killed by lightning.
Tom is a spineless coward.
Why should I be there?
Who brought them?
What are you talking about?
I am a farmer.
I really need to go outside and get some fresh air.
You know it's true.
Are you sad?
Tom is frustrated.
I wasn't even there.
Tom died in October three years ago.
What a fool I've been!
I need to sleep a little.
We don't have sex anymore.
You two must be busy.
Try it again.
She gave birth to twins.
You need a boyfriend.
She is quiet.
Why don't you eat vegetables?
All we want is to be left alone.
What has he done?
Thank you!
You're all they have.
He regretted having borrowed that book from her.
Where do you work?
He gave me 10,000 yen.
He heard it.
Follow me.
A bug bit me.
Tom is trying.
The blood of heroes flows in my veins.
I had no clue what to do.
This song reminds me of my hometown.
He is having lunch.
Tom was arrested in October.
Do you study English?
Who survived?
Good morning!
I learned how to cook from Tom.
I estimate that we'll need two days to finish the work.

Ah, indeed it is.
He's bent on having a doctor's degree before he's thirty.
Is the hotel far from here?
How many kinds of vegetables do you grow in your garden?
These clothes of mine are out of style.
God gave you a penis and a brain, but only enough blood to run one at a time.
Look back!
He came at three in the afternoon.
He came to Japan two years ago.
Life is full of adventure.
I'm trying to do my best.
She became scared when she noticed the man following her.
Do you agree with their decision?
Tom didn't think that anyone would recognize him.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Step aside.
Who called you?

No one escaped alive.
It is true that she is pretty, but she is selfish.
I'm thirsty.
Tom visited Mary on October 20th.
This is a very tall tree.
The wind blew so strongly today, that a tree was knocked over.
You look so much like your mother.
I'm the killer.
Are you crazy?

You're big.
I can feel a new life.
I think you know what we have to do.
So what?
She lived there by herself.
Could you call a doctor, please?
I can't conceive how I could have made such a mistake.
We're cowards.
Everything was burnt to ashes.
Don't worry.
It's hard for my father to give up drinking.
I'm sure you understand that.
Come on!
These are birds.
I regret nothing.
Don't let him fall.

What do you want?
Tom talked.
Is their language difficult?

Not bad.
Help Tom.
I've been saving up to buy a new saxophone.
I miss you.
You're a nice person.
Do you have a better explanation?
We met earlier.
I'm Tom's friend.
It is a shameful fact that, while there are lands where people suffer from hunger, within Japan there are many households and restaurants where much food is thrown away.
Where are you from?
Tell them to be careful.
Who are you?
The coffee tastes like wash water.
I've got no money left.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Damn it! I forgot my password!
It's hot today.

Are these Tom's shoes?
Kiss Tom.
Tom is the only person who can help me now.

It hurts, but we must forget all that's happened.
You're winning.
It's fun to travel.
A child is missing.
Do you think they'll be back for me?
I want to send this postcard to Japan.
Don't you just hate the way Tom always monopolizes the conversation?
Only then did he realize he had been deceived.
Do you realize what time it is?
You said we could go.
Tom got here early.
Tom still can't go home.
The shit smells bad.
Maybe Tom has changed his mind.
You smell like shit.
It's been two years since she left me.
Whose pen is this?
