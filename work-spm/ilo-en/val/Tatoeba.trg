What for?
Tom seems to be excited.
He keeps two cats: one is black, and the other white.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
Don't watch TV until you finish your work.
We'll work.
And I saw the new heaven and the new earth.
We'll continue this discussion later.
You are guilty of murder.
Have I convinced you?
You promised me that you would help.
He isn't able to buy a car.
Tom heard you.
This fruit is very sour.
I need to shit.
What would you like me to tell Tom?
I returned from Boston on October 20th.
We visited our father's grave.
We'll meet again in October.
We need a map.
People live only about 70 years.
I will be fourteen years old tomorrow.
I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
He encountered unexpected obstacles.
I could not solve this problem by any means.
Tom lost.
We want a government so small it can fit in a vagina.
The night is so dark.
Today is Tuesday.
They should wash their feces.
Tom is right behind me.
Tom is a terrorist.
I'm very, very, very concerned.
We never lock our doors around here.
Do you want pepper on it?
This is never going to end.
Mary was shocked when she learned that Tom had had sex with his cousin.
I couldn't think straight.
Help Tom.
Tom, Mary and John have all been invited.
Mary is expecting a baby in October.
I will be back soon.
Brush your teeth every day.
Who would you recommend for the job?
You need new clothes.
The cat escaped.
What's this?
We captured some of the terrorists.
I bought a Picasso.
I have been in Paris.
I'm 18 years old.
Please stay away from us.
Who came here?
Don't you read the tabloids?
The key is on the desk.
She is used to cooking.
Do you believe in God?
They're like family.
He asked us to help him.
Who asked you?
My sister married a doctor.
I have nothing to ask forgiveness for.
I will go if you come.
There were few people on the beach.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
I need you.
How deep?
Do you know where Tom put the keys?
How long have you and Tom been roommates?
We are worn out because we fucked all day long.
Are you a student?
Do you understand me?
The hat does not fit you well. Is too small.
Did you get what you went for?
Being very tired, I fell asleep soon.
I know you're busy, but can I talk to you for a minute?
Hey, what are you doing here?
We might not need to sign a contract.
Has she already finished reading the book?
I was in Boston in October.
You're a coward.
I'm volunteering.
It's not free to get water here.
A glass of water, please.
Tom didn't understand exactly what Mary wanted him to do.
A week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I read a book.
Let's go eat.
She is cold to me.
She is running.
Thanks.
Instead of her, her sister went with them.
They aren't farmers.
Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I forgot my password!
Women want to have sex too.
Don't you even want to know what Tom gave Mary?
They're normal kids.
Do I look like a terrorist?
Tom left at four in the morning.
This woman lied to me.
I turned off the TV and settled down to put the finishing touches to the report.
Tom wrote that song three years ago.
I really need your help.
What time will you have to go to bed?
Disease and famine go together.
Go back to your seat.
What a big truck!
I'm just being careful.
You're trying.
Don't you like your job anymore?
This house is abandoned.
I went to the coffee shop yesterday.
Have a nice day, Tom.
Tom, please be careful.
You have to be careful.
Is Santa Claus real?
Tom did it.
I'll pay.
I'm at a loss for words.
How long did you stay?
Tom promised me that he would come back.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
It's almost half past eleven.
You must read Teen Wolf and watch Road the Perdition.
Do you live here?
I don't want to know what his name is.
Let's start.
Tom will need this.
This tape recorder is not new.
I'm anxious to know the results of the blood test.
Nobody knows it's my birthday today.
Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
Who built this?
I don't know if you remember Tom.
I want to become a doctor in the future.
