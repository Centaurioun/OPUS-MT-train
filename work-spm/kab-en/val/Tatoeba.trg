Tom and Mary are constantly fighting.
Hurry up, Tom.
Walk slowly.
Tom is fat.
Tom is your father.
Tom seemed lost.
You know the way.
He drank beer.
I love reading.
Let's play something.
Because he is there.
I don't want to study tonight.
Get your hand off me.
Awesome!
I've already told you that I'm not the one who did that.
Are you cut?
I'm coming in October.
No problem!
You can always come back.
Some of what you said sounded stupid.
Please remember to mail the letter.
Give me time.
Please leave.
Sure honey.
Can you swim?
Sami and Layla became family.
Wake up!
I'll be calling you every morning.
Law doesn't protect the fools.
Did somebody mention my name?
Keep reading.
You should write a novel.
Our house isn't insulated.
This is Mary's husband.
Tom leaves for Australia on Monday.
I would've understood.
Have you spoken since?
He said he thought that I was dead.
I'll arrive on the twentieth of October.
Don't worry. It's easy.
Just leave me alone.
Aren't they going home?
Understood.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
I like maths.
I want to know more about your country.
Who swam?
Are you a Buddhist?
We must try again.
What's your room number?
Your job hangs by a thread.
I remember seeing that movie.
Why do you have to leave today?
Tom's hair is black.
Tom's plane is landing right now.
Understand?
Tom said he liked teaching French.
Tom does everything by himself.
A glass of water will do you good.
What's new?
Tom and Mary want to live in a French-speaking country.
Time flew.
What's your dad's name?
Repeat!
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Seed after seed will make bread.
Are you American?
Could somebody get me a spoon?
Study hard.
I was born in Boston.
Are you tired?
Why don't you join me?
She disappeared.
You can't drive.
It came apart.
Tom is impolite.
Don't force yourself to eat if you don't want to.
The server is down again.
I'm after him.
Who stayed?
You whispered.
Everybody applauded.
Put your room in order.
Someone is watching.
Do you know what you're doing?
Tom was completely clueless.
Kabyle is your light.
I see we're all here.
They loved you.
You are formidable!
Jump across.
This river is shallow enough to wade to the other side.
Give me your cell phone.
Everyone changes.
Tom wasn't doing anything.
Tom is short.
He loves her like crazy.
Please stop drinking now.
You are not Japanese.
I don't want to get up!
Tom has never been Mary's boyfriend.
Maybe I can come to Boston in October.
Tom is my type.
That's a beautiful name.
Wash your feet.
Did you hear what they were saying?
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Peace upon him.
Are you still in school?
Tom looked.
I don't think I'd like Boston.
Is this the dictionary you're looking for?
Water, please.
She forgot her password.
Everybody smiled.
I said thanks.
Pay heed to your food.
You may enter.
Sami doesn't work here.
Wash your teeth before sleeping!
Tom filed for divorce in October.
Could you sign this?
Tom can leave tomorrow.
Sami became involved with Layla.
He walks fast.
Tom didn't back off.
There you are.
I wanted somebody to talk to.
Would you like me to go there with you?
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
Tom repeated the word several times.
Tom came back to Boston last October.
You are welcome.
Everybody applauded.
Is that French?
Welcome to Tatoeba!
I hope no one saw you.
Slimane knows Djafar.
I heard that Tom kissed Mary.
I have been waiting for an hour and a half.
I hope you've learned something from your mistake.
I know Tom is impatient.
What do you like to read?
Somebody just called.
I much prefer working at night.
"You have friends, don't you?" "Sure."
Tom said that he isn't alone.
We overslept.
French is not only spoken in France.
Tom is divorced.
Tom is hoping to be here in October.
I'll never see her again.
Have you no shame?
Move quietly.
We referred to divorce.
Money doesn't buy happiness.
I allowed Tom to kiss me.
She always smiles at me.
Hello?
You too.
A Mr Sato called in your absence.
How do you vent your anger?
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Who else uses Tatoeba in your office?
I'll buy you that.
Watch Tom.
We've finally reached the summit.
The jar is empty.
Tom is pleased with his success.
Tom will be thirty years old in October.
Everybody smiled.
We're not really asking for money.
Recently.
We don't use force unless necessary.
My grandfather gave me a birthday present.
Why do you want my help?
Follow your dreams.
October is still three months from now.
You heard her, didn't you?
No.
Toughen up!
What are you actually talking about?
Tom remembered.
It's better that way.
Catch it!
What about?
I'm still here in Australia.
I love you very much.
There is a solution though.
Do you have time to eat?
You simply have to call Jean.
I'm Irish.
Tom cooks.
Tom hates it when we do that.
Are you busy?
Are you Catholic?
This town hasn't changed much in the last ten years.
Tom didn't think the story was true.
I'm friends with her brother.
Tom said he was pleased with the results.
Freedom brings forgiveness with it.
There's somebody in the tunnel.
It is about time we were leaving.
Did he say anything about it to you?
Are not you ashamed of yourself?
Take cover!
Do you see the queen?
Happy anniversary!
Somebody saw you.
Stop talking.
I don't eat raw fish.
We were worried about you.
You're a thief.
Source of life.
I missed you very much.
Look closer.
Is the place clean?
Try to keep Tom occupied.
Toto Cutugno said in his song: I'm an Italian, a true one.
Sami was doing this to other kids.
Tom had an air of mystery about him.
I don't eat pears.
Tom fell.
Tom didn't like what Mary did.
Then who?
Tom and Mary are like John and Alice.
Sami could be murdered.
Tom died last October.
Are you leaving?
Tom felt lonely.
Tell me again who will be helping us.
I'm not your slave!
Are you able of swimming?
Maybe later.
Get out!
We'll eat our dinner in the kitchen tonight.
Somebody's following me.
I hate politics.
I've already told you that I'm not the one who did that.
Did Tom say anything before he died?
What line of work are you in?
It happens.
Perhaps not.
Sami was getting bullied.
Masinissa united all the Berbers during his reign.
Tom killed himself last October.
Begin!
Tom is fast asleep on the cot.
Have you ever been to Canada?
Frustrated at not being the exclusive object of her desires anymore, Tom demoted Mary.
World peace.
Quit gambling.
Today's the 20th of October.
Bring wine.
Open your mouth!
You speak tremendously fast.
Tom wanted to punish me.
The pigeon flew away with a message attached to his paw.
Somebody opened the door.
No one here can swim.
Get dressed.
You'd better tell Tom what you expect him to do.
Look around.
Someone called Tom.
I didn't know you had a cat.
Tom almost wasn't able to escape.
Fuck off!
You are writing.
Tell me when you'll call me.
Stand up, please.
The computer broke.
I respect you.
I never forgot you.
Believe me!
Hurry up.
Is there something that you want?
Take an umbrella with you in case it should rain.
You befooled me.
Did you accomplish your purpose?
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
You are childish.
History repeats itself.
Someone is watching Tom.
He was approaching.
We hope it doesn't happen again.
We can make the product a lot easier to evaluate.
I'm very choosy.
How many books have you read?
I called Tom from Australia.
You're new here, aren't you?
Somebody has to stop Tom.
Are you Canadian?
Somebody has died.
In my opinion, you ought to let Tom go.
Clean your room.
It's secret.
Somebody is following us.
You are welcome!
Someone entered the room.
I don't like to make mistakes.
You do not help me.
Tom arrived there before Mary.
Tom visited Australia in 2013.
Are you doing that for me?
Stay down!
There is not much hope.
I want someone to talk to.
Modern Hebrew is easier than Ancient Hebrew.
Ignore it.
Please bring us two cups of coffee.
I need somebody who listens to me.
Please get in.
Let me explain.
Hurry!
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
Are you crazy?
Come!
You have the wrong number.
Are you fucking kidding me?
You are wrong.
Where are your cats?
Keep out.
Take your time.
Did someone die?
Sami found Layla on Facebook.
Tom has seen it, too.
Ready for take-off.
Good job!
Tom took hold of the doorknob and turned it.
He told me a story that you can never believe.
We'd better go.
You know the way.
Have you lost your reason?
You are human.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
Tom isn't going to buy a new car.
It's not important.
Your big sis will show you.
Tom opened a bottle of beer.
He kissed my neck.
You have lipstick on your teeth.
It will snow tomorrow.
Do you think I'll survive?
Tom is likely to do that, isn't he?
Tom did as Mary suggested.
Have you got a dog?
I appear to have misplaced my keys.
Speak slowly!
What people!
What makes you think Tom hasn't done that yet?
Tom received an email from Mary.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Anybody hurt?
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
I like swimming.
I need someone to help me do this.
Why not?
You were so strong.
Tom yawned.
He has a dog.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
This place is crawling with ants.
Tom is a talented actor, isn't he?
Are you widowed?
Tom missed the whole thing.
Tom graduated.
Who wants biscuits?
Are you tough?
Leave it.
We both hate him.
Follow your dreams.
I know the reason why Tom didn't win.
I don't have any money in my pockets.
I don't like you anymore.
Did somebody say something?
See you tomorrow.
His way of thinking is very childish.
Tom will catch Mary.
Seize him!
Have you been to Australia?
Someone attacked Tom.
He sells books.
Do that!
Could you read it?
Someone is calling you.
I know you.
Keep your clothes clean.
This noise is deafening.
Could we ask you a few questions?
I'm too old for Tom.
Tom is going to be thirty in October.
Tom said he'd only talk to you.
They're coming.
There's somebody in the tunnel.
Should I go?
Play there.
Someone's singing.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
They went to Boston.
Tom sent you something.
Are you content?
Are you fully recovered?
Are you listening?
I'm innocent.
We must call the police.
Tom is in Australia.
Tom and Mary swim every day.
I need you to tell me the truth.
Have you got a bike?
Come downstairs.
Tom asked Mary to continue doing what she was doing.
They didn't say that.
Tom smells like a dog.
He wasn't at home when I called on him.
Love lasts.
I'm no friend of yours.
Tom is from Australia.
You are an idiot!
That sometimes happens.
I don't know how to tell Tom this bad news.
Somebody had to do something.
Above all, be kind to old people.
If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it.
I lent my umbrella to Tom and Mary.
Aim higher.
I don't want to eat here.
I'll leave Tom alone.
You are a beautiful woman.
I have a computer.
Tom's trial will begin in October.
Is Tom ill?
The ground seems wet.
Your philosophy of life is different than mine.
Somebody's following me.
Have a drink with me.
Terrific!
Are you hiding something?
You must look to your manners.
Someone is watching Tom.
Tom has two sisters. Both of them live in Boston.
The functions sine and cosine take values between -1 and 1 (-1 and 1 included).
I'm not doing this for you.
Sami was kind of pissed.
They vanished.
Tom moved to a new place.
It will snow tomorrow.
Somebody just called.
Keep going straight.
Mary loves going out with her girlfriends.
Did you check her?
I haven't yet heard that story.
Read it.
Why do people dye their hair?
I changed.
She is a dear friend.
Are you Tom?
Tom wants to protect Mary.
Are you handicapped?
Have you read this book already?
You returned.
What if somebody saw this?
I let Tom kiss me.
Susan, she likes cats.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
Stop arguing.
Come downstairs.
Feed the bird.
How are you feeling?
Tom walked right past Mary.
Their suitcase is too heavy.
Somebody's in trouble.
Get ready.
Was Tom joking?
Give it to whomever you like.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
You need a good woman.
They are very different.
Did he check them?
Don't tire yourself out!
What do you really want to say?
Goodnight, ladies.
She doesn't have any friends.
Be kind.
You had plenty of time.
And who else?
Protect me!
Is this where you live?
Let me out!
Anything else?
Nobody listens.
What a handsome young man!
And who else?
Don't talk to Tom.
Will you be in Boston in October?
Someone stole my passport.
Two coffees, please.
Tom flew to Australia.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
I think that I'm just exhausted.
What did they say?
Tom absolutely detests Mary.
Please do as I say.
Are you thirsty?
Girls are crazy.
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Bring me my glasses.
But what do you want?
I heard something.
Memorize this.
It looks fine.
Something happened to Tom.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
Nobody laughed.
Tom said he intends to go to Australia next October.
What motivates you?
Sami needs to change his address.
I heard someone shouting.
Guess what!
Tom offered a drink to Mary.
Nobody knew.
He knows how to play with words.
Away with you!
Be thankful.
Stand up.
Tom wanted advice from Mary.
Prepare yourself.
Whose is this book?
Tom never told Mary why he did that.
Let them help you.
Did you murder Tom?
You see?
You only imagine you've heard it.
Sami doesn't drive that car much.
You are so pretentious!
You are an idiot!
Have you ever lied to me?
"I loved you, Mary." "Then why did you betray me?"
It is unfortunately true.
Tom was Mary's high school crush.
I heard someone whistle.
Study hard and learn all you can.
Call back.
I'll wait until October.
Layla was Salima's bridesmaid.
Give me a bottle of wine.
I was on the bus.
Come immediately.
Take that!
You are mad.
Give my best regards to your parents.
Who spoke French?
I don't understand art.
Another lonely day.
The rain was falling then the ground sank.
Sami played football.
Tom knows that he isn't going to win.
Tom can understand Mary.
We need you to help us this afternoon.
I'm going to eat now.
Check that.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
You'd better not argue with Tom.
Are you afraid?
Tom walks.
Somebody intervened.
Do you know how to program?
Are you not a teacher?
You're my hero, Sami.
I heard someone whistle.
Hold tight.
Please put a lot of cream in my coffee.
It's not her birthday.
I got lucky.
Read!
Dad isn't home.
Read it.
Sit here.
I know that Tom is a painter.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
Maybe not.
Please wait.
You are worthy.
Tell me something I don't know.
At nightfall I like following the tradition of taking a walk along the lakeside.
Everyone loves you.
Stop moving.
They'd never go there by themselves.
Sami was very worried about me.
He knocked his brother about.
I do not like to make mistakes.
Search me.
No one's seen Tom.
Somebody has to do something.
Run faster, otherwise you will miss the train.
Tom grew up here in Australia.
He is named Jeff by everyone.
Sit!
When I was in Boston, I ran into Tom.
Drive carefully.
Matoub Lounès is the symbol of the struggle for freedom and human rights.
I resigned.
Sami has been following me on Snapchat.
Do it now.
Can you give me a minute with Tom?
It sounds like Tom is crying.
I got lost.
I didn't eat very much.
Tom needs you here.
Somebody's watching us.
Since he found her he never left her.
What do you think they should do?
Our time has come!
Do you speak French?
Examine it.
You can go home now.
I'm not sure Tom would want me to give you that.
Hold on.
I'll buy paper, and other things that I need.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
What is considered impolite in one language may not be considered impolite in another language.
He went to check on his parents.
Tom doesn't want to see anyone.
Please tell me which one to take.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.
Read it again.
You will speak Swedish.
Please don't forget what we discussed.
We slept in the same bed.
Clean the room.
Get dressed quickly.
Who's that fat man?
Are you upset?
Sami has never seen my face before.
You had plenty of time.
The floor gave in under the weight of the heavy safe.
I was happy.
Are you hot?
I hear music.
Tom told Mary that he was thirsty.
The Nightingal singeth the sweetliest of all.
Monday is my busiest day.
It looks like Tom is still groggy.
Tom and I are separated.
I can teach you how to sing.
Tom didn't see it.
Won't somebody help me?
Tom has hired somebody to cook for him.
You need to eat if you want to get strong.
Tom drank.
He's a friend of my brother's.
I'll find a way.
Tom asked Mary to show him the pictures she'd taken.
I sent her home.
Tom died in October last year.
Sami didn't need that.
You're a very rude person.
You have only to believe him.
Have we ever met before?
I didn't know that Tom had so many friends.
I need an aspirin.
Sami didn't have a good morning text from Layla.
I know Tom is very angry.
I don't like what he said.
I called out.
Tom wanted revenge.
Someone is watching.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
Tom is asleep.
Get back here.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Do you smell something?
You are ill.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
Check this.
Snow has been falling steadily since this morning.
Step away from me.
Tom often talks in his sleep.
You're a Boston native, aren't you?
Tom and I went to the party together.
What swagger!
Are you blind?
Tom bought something for Mary.
You are right.
Tom stayed there.
Now I recognize you!
Where do you buy your clothes?
You'll need a flashlight.
I teach French.
We need money.
I read.
You danced.
" How are you ? " - " Things are going well. "
Go early in order to get a good seat.
Let's ask her something else.
I can walk day and night.
I can't get that out of my mind.
I do the shopping every morning.
She attacked him.
Do you see the smile?
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were still doing that?
Thanks, Tom. I'll take it from here.
Are you working?
Fasten your seatbelts.
Keep warm.
You're part of the problem.
We met on October 20th last year.
Have some coffee.
This isn't Australia.
Is your daughter blind?
Tom came with Mary.
Unbelievable!
I rent a car from my friend.
Bring food.
Tom has hired somebody to cook for him.
Pick up the gun.
You are two-faced.
The cat is in the kitchen.
Tom isn't charismatic.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
I read books.
Wait a moment.
Bless you.
Fatima is drunk.
I know what Tom needs.
It was nothing.
She can speak Japanese.
It was over too quickly.
I want children.
I love Tom.
I'm expecting.
I'll never forget the day I met Tom.
The sooner you return, the happier your father will be.
Tell them.
I'll leave in October.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
What are you doing for Halloween?
She knows the truth.
Be careful, there's a car!
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Tell them the truth.
I know who left early.
I will give him the book tomorrow.
You have many friends.
Do only what I did!
Tom looks bored.
I have a musical voice.
Tom missed the whole thing.
Clearly you are mistaken.
Nothing changes.
You said you needed help.
Remember last year.
Look back!
You are a snake!
Tom couldn't save Mary.
Very!
Tom tossed the book on the couch.
Leave us.
Did someone say something?
Did you call?
Tom is with somebody.
What did your mom say?
Tom, this is Mary.
Somebody's waiting for you.
I didn't even know his name.
I'll call you as soon as I get to Chicago.
Look, look!
He had jeans on.
Tom isn't likely to be at tonight's party.
Is it the truth?
Tom can't stay here by himself.
They dream.
The man who I thought was my friend deceived me.
This plan was approved last October.
Can you please help me?
Pull.
Sami met Layla.
I am worthless in English.
Why can't we play tennis today?
You are ill.
We'll do that later.
I never liked biology.
Remember last year.
Where will you be tomorrow?
He sprained his foot.
Kurt Cobain died on 5 April 1994 in Seattle.
Tom hasn't been seen since October.
I need someone to help me do this.
I have a guitar.
I prefer to read.
You could have been mistaken.
It happened.
I don't doubt that.
You lie.
Someone called Tom.
Each one keeps his belief for himself.
He filled the bathtub with water.
Tom and Mary sat way in the back.
Can you find it?
You're our prisoner.
Come closer.
I need someone to help me.
What do you say to that, Tom?
Tom studies French.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Tom speaks French.
Who ran?
Someone might see us.
How interesting!
Who's talking?
Can't you see we're talking?
Do you enjoy Tom's company?
I speak Ancient Greek.
Would you mind if I sit at the same table?
Tom winked.
Tom answered in detail.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Leave Tom alone.
What are those flowers called?
I read it wrong.
I'm Brazilian.
Sami hates rap music.
Be careful!
Sami sees Layla once a year.
However the work is finished.
He misses his family.
Tom never told Mary why he did that.
I believed everything they told us.
Step inside.
Tom is poor.
Are you tough?
Everyone escaped.
You must not stay here.
Tom fought.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Escape!
You told me that you are eating.
Tom hated Mary.
We're positive that they forgot to call us.
Be punctual.
We were friends.
Somebody has died.
You and I love games.
Who told you I couldn't swim?
Somebody might stop us.
Your face is getting red.
Did he say anything about it to you?
Mr. White's yard is large.
I missed you very much.
Please fix it.
He spoke.
Please ask Tom to leave.
It turns out that you knew everything but kept quiet.
She admired him.
Tom walked out on Mary.
Tom is getting married in October.
Peace be with you.
Get a haircut.
Maybe they should've told Tom the truth.
Away with you!
That's never happened to me.
If Tom can't do it, nobody can.
Mary opened the window.
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
I am happy.
I remember posting your letter yesterday.
If the sun were to go out, all living things would die.
I've been thinking about it the entire day.
I'm happy here.
Speed kills.
That house is big.
Tom's birthday is in October.
He was heartbroken.
Listen up.
The children played together.
I think Tom is a Christian.
I don't want you to stay here and watch me suffer.
Hey, you.
Why couldn't you do that?
I might not be able to go to Australia with you next week.
I'm starting a new life.
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
You could kill someone.
I lent him my car.
Where is my watch?
They relaxed.
Somebody might stop me.
I know what Tom needs.
I left my dog at home.
Be attentive.
Come in.
Did you eat lunch?
Ready for take-off.
Do you want to see our English lesson?
Someone's outside.
Did she tell the truth?
You still don't like Tom, do you?
I'll give you my car.
I demand the truth.
Stay down!
You have to help.
Shut the door.
I respect you.
Jump.
Give me the ball!
If you want to swim, swim.
This only happens in Australia.
I left Australia on October 20th.
I know you.
Are they speaking French?
When did Tom get to Boston?
After I closed all the doors, I went to sleep.
Please let me pay.
Stand by.
Tom won a trophy.
I need a little affection.
I am learning Spanish.
Where have you been?
There are a lot of things I need to do before I can go home.
I made that for you.
Me!
Are you busy?
Why don't you go to school?
Sport is health.
Tom is three inches taller than me.
They replaced that factory's employees with mechanical arms.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
What problems did you find?
Behave yourselves.
Really?
You first.
Please lend me your car.
I always walk.
Tom apologized to Mary.
You are taller than I.
Make coffee.
Don't tickle me!
Please come on time.
Stop daydreaming and come down of your tree!
She dreamed of their future together.
She swims well.
Tom can rest as long as he wants.
Be punctual.
When I run, I get sweaty.
Tom grinned.
I heard what happened.
Mary is cooking.
Sami was beating Farid's ass.
Answer as soon as possible!
Richard Dawkins is a famous atheist.
Will you go to Boston tomorrow, too?
This river isn't deep enough for this kind of boat.
How long has Tom been teaching French?
I don't feel hungry at all.
I want to call my lawyer.
Go find somebody who can help.
Let's open the window.
I make €100 a day.
You should ask somebody else.
I couldn't do otherwise.
How often did you go swimming last summer?
We made it.
I'm really sorry!
Dance!
Straighten up.
Tom's room is always neat.
What are these?
Snow has been falling steadily since this morning.
Did somebody mention my name?
You have lipstick on your teeth.
Tom forgot to pay the electric bill.
Tom wanted to have another baby, but his wife didn't.
Tom blamed it on Mary.
No idea.
Prepare yourself.
I haven't said anything yet.
How many computers did you say you had?
Mary was gorgeous.
Keep looking.
No one will find out.
Tom wanted to scare Mary.
I'm fairly busy.
Tom never changes.
I apologize.
Tell him tomorrow.
Tom came to help Mary.
Tom is bald.
I thought he loved me.
Careful!
You could get milk from the cows.
You're one of the most interesting people I've ever met.
This tastes good.
At first, he could not speak English at all.
Tom is laughing.
Tom seemed nice.
What if Tom's plan doesn't work?
I've been told Tom is still in Australia.
I made you coffee.
Pay heed to your food.
I know why Tom is here.
Tom knows I'm not afraid of anybody.
OK, I won't do it again.
You speak.
Did you murder Tom?
Why did Tom kiss me?
Tom doesn't trust Mary.
Are you thirsty?
Everyone escaped.
You are lazy!
Tom is quiet.
I like literature.
His way of thinking is very childish.
I'll buy you that.
Did you give Tom a present for his birthday?
Tom is unstoppable.
Stay inside.
You walk quickly!
You are weak.
I mistook him for his brother.
Have another cookie.
Do you like dogs?
You do not know me.
I hear somebody talking.
Everybody loved Tom.
October isn't so far off.
Tell us the truth.
You can get in touch with Tom at his home tonight.
Please remember me to your parents.
I love what you are.
Tom will always love Mary.
We want to get to know you.
Have you ever worked with them?
He ran.
You should ask somebody else.
Everybody agrees.
Good luck with your work!
I thought somebody died.
Everyone ignored them.
Everyone stayed in Boston except Tom.
Could somebody please answer me?
Tom underestimated Mary.
Do you have a table near the window?
Tom looks bored.
Who cheered?
Lie still.
Stand up!
Lead the way.
Sometimes they talk about revolution.
Her baby can't speak.
Sami changed his address.
Tom figures that he isn't alone.
I know you left early.
Talk to somebody.
Sami put the coins in that slot machine.
Abbott killed Mary.
Stop moving.
What do they want from them?
The summer vacation is over.
Tom didn't understand Mary.
I'm a French teacher.
She swims.
Girls are crazy.
It was our secret.
Tom is truthful.
How do you take your coffee?
Do you study or work?
Do you watch TV every day?
Where's your God now?
Close your eyes.
Walk!
Come here soon.
You are human.
Tom wants to meet Mary.
If you knew how much I hate you!
This is very easy.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
The sentence is OK.
What cheese do you want?
Pick up the gun.
Do you enjoy losing?
Well, I'm just watching TV...
Carry this.
Can you see?
What the hell do you want from me?
Somebody made a mistake.
Do you have school today?
Please let me pay.
Are you tall?
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
You can drive if you want.
I saw somebody kiss Tom.
Forget Tom.
Tom tried to cut his own hair.
Please find him.
Follow us.
Somebody just called.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Are you really going to eat all that?
I take care of my body.
Girls are crazy.
Someone stole my passport.
If you eat that, you'll die.
Get inside.
Tom didn't think about Mary.
I approve.
Somebody has broken this dish.
Do you like France?
Stop crying.
Are you a kid?
You said you needed help.
I'd like a ticket to Boston.
Put it there.
I know that you're here, Tom.
Nobody came.
Where did the other one go?
What have you done today?
French is difficult.
I hope no one saw you.
Read on.
Can you add me?
Keep your clothes clean.
French is very difficult to learn.
She tried.
Seriously?
For some reason I couldn't access my e-mail.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Tom is kind of strange.
What concerns most people is the air they breathe, the food they eat and the water they drink - water that helps to grow the food they eat.
She misses him.
I have to lock this door.
Did somebody mention my name?
I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
You make me feel dizzy!
I cheated.
Tom won't let you go.
Are you new?
I'm not making excuses.
Are you ready?
It is rare to find Kabyles who sell their land.
Did someone die?
When did Tom finally leave?
Your job hangs by a thread.
Pay attention.
I think Tom knows things that we don't.
What is your friend's name?
Did somebody hit Tom?
You are worthy.
Tom turned to Mary.
Is that the remote control?
I hope no one saw you.
I want names.
You should be talking to Tom.
Maybe Tom saw something.
I turned right.
Where did you cook them?
Get outside right now.
That book is very old.
Can I go home now?
The talented comedian Danny Boon is a Kabyle.
How much bread did you eat?
Tom is afraid to go outside.
I've already told Tom that I plan on staying in Australia for another three weeks.
Tom cooked dinner.
He was married to her sister.
She stopped talking.
Have you become insane?
Two years is a long time to wait.
Neither Tom nor Mary died in the accident.
Sit down!
I don't think I like it.
Sami lived across from us.
The word "family" has 3 syllables.
Somebody came to our house.
Do you understand what he's saying?
Can you see?
I read this book in Rome.
Turn left.
I heard that Tom and Mary will get married in October.
I lied when I said I didn't like Tom.
Has someone died?
Tell me that you've forgiven me.
We could go to prison for this.
You talked to them, didn't you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Ahmed is a jealous person.
Have another cookie.
Why does Tom want my help?
You returned.
Do you like dogs?
Maybe later.
Come over here.
You could get milk from the cows.
Forget it.
Congratulations!
I cannot hate you.
You just sit there and wait until Tom gets back.
Monkeys climb trees.
Do you like science fiction movies?
It's not worth it!
The water that my mother will not give me from her jug, will never quench my thirst.
I'm not in love with him.
Did anybody come?
You are human.
Somebody will see us.
Thank you for showing me around Boston.
Tell me something I don't know.
Somebody is watching us.
Are you helping him?
I can't go swimming with you today.
The phone call was recorded.
Tom carefully cut the tissue with scissors.
She grimaced.
Sami is moving out.
I've got to get them a present.
He understands at a glance.
Have you got a little sister?
Tom should be back by October.
You are an idiot!
Tom repeated the word several times.
I received an invitation.
This web project offers an introduction to Kabyle with lessons and exercises, which will be corrected.
What are Tom and Mary arguing about?
This river isn't very deep.
Someone stole my money.
Tom is quite likely to be late.
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
Can somebody give me a hand here?
Hear! Hear!
Cool off!
Did Tom say anything to you before going out?
Close the door, please.
Tom says he's never milked a cow.
I'm not going to hurt you.
It rained.
Our time has come!
Stop reading.
She hates the Algerian authority.
Stand by.
Tell me something I don't know.
Did something happen?
I got lost.
I thought he would come.
Tom and I are married now.
Tom looks very happy.
Somebody touched me.
Do you think anyone can see me?
We are expecting company this evening.
How do you vent your anger?
What's your friend's name?
I start.
What time was it when you got here?
Have you lost your reason?
I hate Tom.
The worst has passed already.
I want someone to talk to.
Smile.
Support Tatoeba!
She eats.
You must look to your manners.
Somebody wants to kill me.
Was the umbrella you found Tom's?
I just don't love Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
Where is your key?
Have another.
Are you ill?
I've decided to tell the truth.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Say nothing.
Call Tom immediately.
I know Tom's secret.
Thanks for your encouragement.
They don't help.
Tom found something.
French bread is delicious.
I knew that you'd cry.
The boy is nice.
Stop that!
You are rich.
I do not really remember that girl anymore.
Don't talk behind my back.
Who is absent?
Give my best regards to your parents.
Tom can understand Mary.
Fire!
They run.
Come closer.
I think Tom has done that at least one time.
I wasn't a good student in high school.
How is Tom?
Tom loves singing.
Stop dreaming.
Sami held Layla's hand.
I know the road
Why don't you go see Tom?
Tom isn't likely to know where Mary lives.
Have you lost your reason?
Dad isn't home.
I wanted to do that yesterday, but I couldn't.
Tom is undressing.
Tom has told me so much about you.
Kisses are not a sin.
I'm no friend of yours.
Someone stole my watch.
I will be back soon.
Someone's talking.
Sami sat in a corner.
You're wet through.
I suspect that Tom and Mary were busy.
You're part of the problem.
Please call him.
You are an idiot!
Listen.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
What are we waiting for?
Tom began talking.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
I know we're different.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
I need to be alone to think.
Tom will replace Mary.
You need not have such fear.
Let me show you something else.
Did Tom say anything else about me?
I don't think it's convincing.
I followed him.
Welcome!
Everyone thinks so.
Someone made a mistake.
Your philosophy of life varies from mine.
Let me be.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
Your job hangs by a thread.
Sami started smoking weed.
What's my prize?
Buy!
Just let me in.
Tom beat up Mary.
Be respectful at least.
Tom deleted Mary's email message.
Where does your grandmother live?
Your philosophy of life is different than mine.
I think there's something in the box.
Computers make people stupid.
I really need to talk to you.
There is nothing open.
Kiss him.
You shouldn't go to work.
It's my brother's.
Today is the twentieth of October.
Keep singing.
Why have you come only now?
Go!
Tom will never forget Mary.
Tom sounds exhausted.
Away with you!
Years do not wait, no matter how much men may wait.
Why did you call?
Someone is watching.
I'm not your slave!
Do you know Georgian?
You're coming to Montreal this weekend?
We trusted you.
She had never taken the subway.
Who did you expect to win?
Are you jealous?
What do we call you?
Whenever you come, you are welcome.
Follow my advice.
I hope to be back by October 20th.
It's up to you.
Whose is it?
I'm not your slave!
Tom is very timid.
Tom is extremely polite.
I want to drink tea.
How do you like this outfit?
I don't want the money now.
Tom exaggerates.
You refused to pay.
We'll have to do something.
Have you lost your reason?
What line of work are you in?
Try to keep Tom from doing that.
Tom is with somebody.
Were you surprised to see her?
You must have dropped your phone in your haste to catch the bus.
Why didn't you bring it home?
Did you forget something?
Please don't touch the flowers.
Tom coughed.
Did somebody mention my name?
Who will fill in for Tom when he is away?
Everyone knows.
You're just the person I want to speak to.
Fuck you!
I was not a good mother.
I was able to drive a car.
Tom is a heavy smoker, isn't he?
I'm undressing.
Haven't you had your dinner?
Tom has hired somebody to cook for him.
The world is now a better place.
Everybody knew.
Sami was swimming in his pool.
Marie should start.
Fix this.
I'm eating bread.
Never say that.
You're older than Tom.
What are we gonna do???
I helped.
He died.
How do you relax after work?
How interesting!
I can't eat meat.
What is your friend's name?
Tom is very pale.
No.
Did somebody get hurt?
Tom didn't know what Mary was going to buy.
Some of the apples in the box were rotten.
Speak clearly.
Stop him.
The water is not fit to drink.
Look alive.
Let go of my hand.
Ask Tom.
Old people think they are the only ones who are right.
Somebody set the fire.
Tom told Mary he'd never met John.
Tom gave Mary a heart-shaped cookie.
I'm a little busy.
Please look at this.
Where do you live now?
I have two sisters and one brother.
Are you American?
Try to keep her occupied.

Our fridge is broken.
Tom moved to a new place.
The story takes place in Boston.
Tom has been in Boston about a week.
Tom and I used to be real good friends.
Tom is writing something.
There's somebody out there.
Tom looks tired.
Let's hope for good results.
At school.
If you don't want to read, don't.
You betrayed your country.
I got somebody to help me do that.
Hey, you.
Tom just left.
Watch yourselves.
I'll arrive on October 20th.
Understood.
What're you going to do this weekend?
Let me hear from you.
Ask Alex.
How can I know if a girl likes me?
How long have you been living in this house?
Don't ever think otherwise.
When did you buy this house?
Tom loved us both.
Let her go!
Your eyes are lying.
We heard the speech to the end.
Life goes on.
I don't want to eat here.
Do you know his birthplace?
Why do you want a horse?
Someone entered the room.
He asked after you.
I return to Boston in October.
I missed you very much.
Nothing changes.
Bring her home.
Please pass me the sugar.
Tom is your father.
I am crazy about you.
You may eat now.
Are you ready to order now?
Somebody knocked at the door.
Mine's bigger than yours.
Farewell!
Do you see the star?
You should be talking to Tom.
Just relax.
I had to tell somebody.
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
Tom scares me.
Tom looks busy this morning.
You are so pretentious!

Time flew.
Guess what!
Your waiter will be right with you.
Tom made a promise to come home early tonight.
Tom wrote to Mary.
You are always complaining.
Wash everything.
Asshole!
Tom is asleep.

She keeps secrets.
I teach English.
I want Tom.
What's become of Tom?
I love math.
I did that without anybody's help.
We slept.
Tom wants to return to his country.
We have read.
What's the plan?
Why do you feel that way?
Mary lied about taking the money.
To live without hope is to cease to live.
Tom said he had no intention of leaving Boston.
I prayed.
Tom is now looking for another job.
I've never been to Boston, and Tom hasn't, either.

Everyone agrees.
Go.
What do we call you?
Tom can swim.
Don't tell anyone.
I know Tom is unmarried.
Mary ran.
Close your eyes.
Why did you do it?
We must try again.
When did you make this?
Why did you fire Tom?
We need you to help us this afternoon.
I went to a Halloween party.
Come immediately.
Tom isn't going to be back until October.
Somebody poisoned me.
Would you like coffee or tea?
Close it.
The war ended.
Read this.
Sorry...
Tom hasn't been to Boston since October.
I'm afraid for you.
Sami started at that man.
Put it on the floor.
Go wash up before dinner.
She's a yoga teacher.
Somebody's in trouble.
Have you ever added an article to Wikipedia?
Life goes on.
Yesterday, I slept early.
If the weather is fine tomorrow, we'll go out to the forest.
Have you lost your reason?
I'm going to show you how it's done.
Sit at the table.
You are not to smoke here.
Somebody is watching us.
Take him away.
I still remember doing that.
You don't recognize me, do you?
What do you do in Boston?
Tom is now at home with his family.
Tom is planning to meet Mary at the airport.
Coffee does harm to your stomach.
I hope to see you again.
Hello!
This is the solution.
Can you swim?
How I have missed you!
Carry this.
She will find her husband.
Everyone looked.
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
Sami did leave.
Can somebody help me?
I loved going to the beach.

Please don't die.

They want to learn English.
Release Tom.
I wonder why.
If you knew how much I love you!
Tom didn't see you.
Make a wish.
You are a pretty girl.
Everyone changes.
What size are your shoes?
Are you going to sing?
Ask Alex.
If you want your money back, you can have it.
I'll give you a call before I come.
Are you mocking me?
Where did you learn Italian?
What time was it when you got here?
Beer is my fuel.
Tom and I went to school together.
Do you know Tom's password?
Fix this.
I am thinking another way.

Neither of my brothers can swim.
I'm not interested in your religion.
Ignore it.

Somebody has to do it.
Stop pushing.
We trusted you.
Someone entered the room.
They're over there, you know, with their dog.
I didn't know you had a brother.
You're wrong.
My skirt is too long.
How's Tom?
Aren't you going to join me?
Tom wasn't kind to Mary.
We are men.
Whom do you expect?
I'm glad you were there.
Do you like science fiction movies?
Mary needed to change her plan.
I ended your sleep.
Everyone gossips.
If you want to eat that, you may.
Birds fly.
Escape!
Somebody was in the house.
Do you mind if I eat here with you?
Close your book.
Tom got kicked out of school.
Are you fully recovered?
I have a couple of Canadian friends.
Read it again.
Did I just say that?
I wished him a good night.
He was wounded in the battle.
I don't speak your language.
Dogs have masters, cats have servants.
Tom yelled at Mary.
You won.
It is getting warmer day by day.
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Tom will never believe me again.
Did you check her?
Tom and Mary will get married in October.
Explain yourself.
Look behind you.
I am not breaking anything.
Did Tom come?
Step forward.
Good question.
I have a better idea.
Big snowflakes are falling.
I actually use this.
They have water.
Not yet.
Did someone die?
Try to keep Tom busy.
We traveled around Australia.
Stay with me for a moment.
I'm sure you'll like her.
Kill me.

They kissed.
What're you going to do this weekend?
After eating, the first thing I do is brush my teeth.
Stop apologizing.
Good luck with your work!

I'm done.
Tom knows.
You are so pretentious!
Come downstairs.
They're dead.
I want to learn Chinese next year.
You should eat something.

He is a boy from Mexico.
He likes his Kabyle language.

I'm glad you were there.
Tom abused Mary.
Everything was lost.
Someone is watching.
I won't repeat this, so listen carefully.
Drink something.
That's because you're a girl.
You are broke, man!
Children love Halloween.
Would you come our house?
Are you expecting somebody?
I play the piano.
On my way home, I met him.
The two men were business partners.
Tom felt hungry.
I hear something.
Tom is my date.
Someone attacked Tom.
Stop trying.
How long?
A friend of mine called me last night.
It's my brother's.
Stars began to appear in the sky.
Live!
Open your eyes.
Tom is poor.
We need you to help us this afternoon.
I'm afraid we must go if we want to get home before dark.
I know the reason why Tom was crying.
Please let me pay.
He loves her.
They're empty.
I ate lunch at around eleven because I was hungry.
Somebody attacked Tom.
Are you listening?
Hello, I am Nancy.
You should eat something.
Somebody was murdered.
Sami read a lot.
Sami found that kind of strange.
Tom has departed for Australia.
I crashed.
Construction could begin in October.
Now that we've finished eating, let's go.
Save him.
I'll buy you that.
Are you sleeping?
Tom says that he likes the idea.
Nobody knows why.
This is my Japanese friend.
I have a table.
All gone.
Is there something troubling you?
I hope you're doing well.
Keep oil away from the fire.
There's somebody in the tunnel.
Good night, Tom.
What do you want from Tom?
You speak like your mother.
I finished the work yesterday.
I don't have to wear glasses any more.
Tom was born on October 20th, 2013.
Tom asked me to dance.
I think you did that intentionally.
You should ask somebody else.
Tom killed someone.

I want you to stand up.
I'm no friend of yours.
Somebody might've overheard you.

How old is your grandfather?
Coming soon.
I'm coming to Boston in October.
Save them.
Tell them that I'm here.
I don't think I'll ever go back to Boston again.
Tom sympathized.
You look sick.
I just ordered a coffee, because I was not hungry.
Tom was with Mary.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Get back here.
Don't eat that.
Do you have a mental problem?
We studied English.
Just talk with them.
Somebody should do something.
Tom will be missed.
Tom thought that Mary might've been brainwashed.
Tom needs you here.
That's one of my dogs.
I hear somebody talking.
She doesn't smile for me anymore.
Understood.
Who is there?
I'm in the kitchen.
Everyone laughed.
Did you get some sleep?
You look like you're certain.
Be still.
Which tooth hurts?
There is nothing there.
No one's here.
Is there anything we can do?
Somebody help me.
If f is not an epimorphism, then it factors through g.
Do you want me to open this now?
Tell me what's wrong.
I believe you like your job.
You should have absolute rest.
Then who?
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
Tom was mesmerized by Mary.
Somebody attacked Tom.
Tom told me he'd wait.
Are you not tired?
Are you Julius?
Go with peace.
Tom walked.
Do you want anything to eat?
Maybe somebody wants that.
They're lying.
Answer them.
You are so smart!
Tom and Mary are constantly fighting.
Tom enjoys reading.
Shut up!
Tom insulted Mary.
A Mr Sakaki has come to see you.
Eat everything you wish.
Tom visited Australia.
Kabylians love Japanese.
How unlucky I am!
She laid the paper out on the table.
Tom will sit here.
Everyone giggled.
How stupid he is!
Let's play this game.
How do you propose to help?
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
Take these.
Have you forgotten your money?
I'm expecting a phone call this morning.
I said shut up!
Why do you hate dogs so much?
I saw a dog and its tail was cut short.
You fainted.
Tom causes me a lot of extra work.
She is very wise.
Forget him.
Pace yourself.
The water of this fontain is drinkable.
What cheese do you want?
Have you found something?
I was just thinking about you.
Tom is in Boston, but Mary isn't.
Read it once more.
Let me show you something else.
You can always come back.
I am thinking day and night.
Do you see anyone here?
Close the door, please.
You don't have a heart.
I love your son.
What pains you, pains me too.
Tom and Mary say they're not tired yet.
Somebody was talking to Tom.
He could speak French.
Did Tom say anything about his accident?
Tom and I went to the party together.
I think Tom deserves that.
You make me feel dizzy!
Try to keep him occupied.
I am!
I understand why Tom did that.
"々" means the previous kanji is repeated.
What if somebody sees you?
What do you read?
The ox is the male of the cow.
Somebody will do that.
I didn't lie. You did.
It's so heavy that I can't lift it.
Do we know each other?
Stop apologizing.
I've seen Tom.
Consider it.
Tom waited for Mary.
Keep this.
Do you want your wife to speak Esperanto?
I'm not your slave!
Tom and I talked about many things.
This is a good day.
I would like to pay, please.
Stop here.
Tom never kisses his wife anymore.
I suspect Tom is ready.
Someone stole my money.
This is my opinion, not yours.
Let me remind you of something.
He prefers sleeping on the ground.
I don't want to go back there.
Apes are intelligent.
Do you play any sports?
Aren't you going to read this book?
You're truthful.
They're using you.
Tom was found dead on October 20th.
I got no response from anyone.
Change your clothes.
Sami is talking to a customer.
Correct errors.
She writes beautifully.
Sami bought two wigs from Amazon.
Tom is nervous.
Who stood?
Come.
Let them help you.
Take this.
Our cultur will never vanish.
Smell this.
You've never been to Paris?
Please take out your homework.
Do you have any animals?
I know a place we can get something to eat.
I think Tom is good-looking.
They don't seem happy.
Freeze!
Tom vanished.
Tom is a hunk.
Whose books are these?
We want to help Tom do that.
You need not have such fear.
Don't touch.
Who fights can lose. Who doesn't fight has already lost.
Grab him!
Tom felt cold.

Since that day, I do not sleep anymore.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
Somebody stole my lunch.
Haste makes waste.
You're hiding something.

Tom enjoys reading books.
I can do it by myself!
Are those your daughters?
Are you not a teacher?
We should go to sleep.
Is he working tomorrow?
Tom doesn't have a ticket.
Look carefully. I'm going to show you how it's done.
Tom arrived ahead of Mary.
I'll be leaving in October.
The status quo goes on.

Do you like playing football?
Stop them!
Somebody else might get hurt.
Forget her.
Is there anything you don't like to eat?
Truth alone triumphs.
Tom probably did that on October 20th.
Look again.
You are so smart!
Sami doesn't know what the fuck to do.
Sami wasn't smart.
We saw nothing.
I won't leave you.
Nobody is indispensable.
Are you popular?
Everyone smiled.
Tom attempted to rescue Mary.
They ran.
Sami was trying to help that lady.
You are happy.
Is your daughter blind?
Stop dreaming.
Come outside.
I thank you for your gift.
I always walk.
Let's play this game.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
What's your problem?
Do it now.
I don't want you to understand.
I was told not to do that.
Tom has never been seriously ill in his life.
Stay absolutely still.
Everybody jumped.
He gave me everything he had.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Somebody might stop you.
Ask anyone.
You still don't understand.
They yelled.

You're the love of my life.
What book are you reading?
Tell him tomorrow.
Tom will find Mary.
October is over.
The leaves fell.
Please hurry!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom was furious with Mary.
Grab that.
How tall are you?
I shouldn't have trusted them.
Tom and I used to go to the same school.
I don't eat much fruit.
I'm going to get you out of here.
Nobody cares who you are.
Tom and Mary are as different as black and white.
I do like you.
Please take me to my seat.
I'm looking for somebody.
This is a bee.
It failed.
I hope you understand.
Suddenly, something unexpected happened.
Where do you live now?
I know that you're here, Tom.
The poor man eats when he can, but the rich man eats when he wants.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
Tom eats when he is stressed.
I should like to go with you.
Someone had to do that.
You are old.
Please go home.
I want to impress everyone.
Are you unhappy?
Be careful.
Are you mad?
Are you worried?
What should I do with this cat?
Where did you get all those keys?
Will you come with me?

Buy!

Is there somebody you want to see?
She was sick.
My feet are frozen.
Where will you go?
He needs to travel to England this summer.
Start now.
Really!
How do you vent your anger?
Goodbye, Sayoko.
To tell the truth, they are not husband and wife.
Please, look ahead!
Sami has problems with those types of things.
I'm hungry!
Sit here.
He dug his own grave.
Be calm.
How many do you have?
Bring your wallet.
We must go.
Did you get some sleep?
Did you listen to his new song?
We had nothing to eat.
Sami found trash in the hallway.
I'm Tom's sister.
Somebody's coming.
It's windy today, isn't it?
You're all happy.
Come with me now.
She is kissing him.
Thanks.
We are 5 in my family.
What a fright I got when I opened the door!
Hello!
Aim higher.
You must look to your manners.
I gave everything to Tom.
I'm hungry! Let's go and have dinner please!

Talk.
It will be all better if you can come now.
Are you studying?
You are a panda.
I just don't know what to say.
Read this.
How weird!
Swimming at night is dangerous.
Sign here.

Can you see?
Are you English?
Pass me the salt, please.
I wonder where they are.
Somebody stole my car.
Welcome to Canada!
That's what you told me last week.
Wash your face.

Have you found something?
He's a bit tipsy.

Since yesterday.
He accelerated.
Are you joking?
I'm sure you'll like her.
They danced.

Are you going to sell Tom your house?
How far?

What're they doing?
How many do you have?
She sat there in silence.
Leave me alone!
Can I ask a stupid question?
Your moment has arrived!
I laughed.
I read it incorrectly.
Sami and Layla will see each other tomorrow.
I will give her the book tomorrow.
His idea is superior to yours.

Aren't you about the same age as Tom?
Somebody's waiting for you.
How embarrassing!
I want to sit in the middle.
Bon appetit.
This is unprecedented.
Tom entered my house.
No one left.
Where do you live now?
I want to buy this jacket.
What problems did you find?
Stop yelling!
Home!

I hate French.
This stinks.
Your son is a nice, fine young man.
Have you asked if they want one?
Please reply.
Yell!
Tom was standing behind Mary.
Nothing happened.
You'd better put on a raincoat.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Do you want to eat now?
Did you get some sleep?
Could we have a spoon?
Tom saw it.
You are foolish.
One of them is a spy.

How would they find out?
I like my Kabyle language.
Have you found something?
Don't you have to work tomorrow?
Fly.
Sami has been there for five or six months.

You're all happy.

Don't talk to Tom.
I was happy.
This is for you.
I was about to go out when the phone rang.
I'll buy you something to eat.
Quiet down, please.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
Brothers are brothers but greed separated them.
Tom eats when he's stressed.
Try this.
I regret I didn't tell Tom the truth.
They invited me to the wedding.
Who? Me?
Please stop it.
There is a time for everything.
I haven't smoked for ages.
May I ask who you are?
It's kind of you to drive me home.
No, I do not know your brother.
I'm freezing.
Is anybody here?
They'll be playing soccer tomorrow.
I need the truth.
What's your address?

Is it true?
Smell this.
I run.
Help me.
When did you get to Boston?
Tell them.

Try to keep Tom from leaving early.
Are those your parents?
I would like to live a century.
We read.
Has Tom cleaned the room yet?
I told you this is what would happen.
You'd better go back home now.
All right.
We were worried about you.
What do you think they should do?
You have only to wait here.
It is a small dog.
There never was a good war nor a bad peace.
Are you asleep?

Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I know you're writing a book.
I need you to tell me the truth.
I hear you clear.
Please read that book.
I can speak your language.
Return immediately.
It looks like I got here too early.
Tom blinked.
Can I ask a dumb question?
I will trust you with one secret.
Please think no more about it.
I hope no one saw you.
Mary looks beautiful.
Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late for lunch.
Make it smaller.
Are you Masensen or Mohand ?
Tom has many good ideas.
I hope no one saw you doing that.
You can change that if you want.
Read it.
Someone is calling you.
Your time has arrived!
Come in.
It's my brother's.
Tom may be back tomorrow.
It's no use arguing about it.
Was I wrong?
Somebody has broken this dish.
See you tomorrow.
Who speaks French?
The teacher went through my purse.
Layla was dating a bad boy.
Do you want to help me?
Tom and I walked together.
It wasn't cold.
Look behind you.
Try to keep Tom from doing that.
You speak tremendously fast.
You can use my computer if you want.
Thanks, that's all.
Could we have a table outside?
Maybe you'd better come with us.
I hate this kind of place.
Clearly you are mistaken.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Please go.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Read.
I don't eat raw fish.
Someone called.
Comfort her.
Tom called his wife and told her that he'd be late for dinner.
Tom handed Mary his keys.
Tom hasn't yet responded to our request.

Catch Tom.
Why do I have to do this alone?
Sami didn't see Layla cry at all.
Tom loves a good party.
How many books do you have?
I'm telling the truth.
Tom told me not to go there alone.
Sami's bag looked like a purse.
You should come visit us!
Now I recognize you!
Your big sis will show you.

Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Someone's calling.
Have you ever learned how to play the guitar?
We sat by the river.
I continued reading.
I have to talk to somebody.
Forget me.
Tom wore his Halloween costume to school.
Somebody just called.
Who is calling, please?
Someone's singing.
What do you usually do when you get sick?
Where does your grandmother live?
I love you more than Tom does.
We need more evidence.
I bought it.
I hope they're OK.
Tom is rich.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
I'm no friend of yours.
Words are over.
Would you pass me the cream cheese, please?
No questions?
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
Tom went home.
Are you a foreigner?
I've heard Tom is planning to move to Australia.
You don't really want to eat with us, do you?
Stay with me for a moment.
Who went with you?
Did anyone tell him?
Do you love Tom?
Tom always seems to win.
Sami is going upstairs.
I need someone to help me.
Lower your voice.
You are so pretentious!
Lower your voice.
Tom showed Mary something.
I sat on chewing gum.
Tom loves me.
Follow me!
There is a limit to everything.
It rained.
Save yourself.

Since when?

You're not going to die here.
They'll do what I tell them to do.
Somebody was talking to Tom.
You'll find somebody.
She had always found him handsome.
He mocked me.
You were at home yesterday, weren't you?
Save her.
You must go to bed now.
Tom never talked about you.
Tom is coming, isn't he?
Just let me see it.
Watch her.
I like tea.
Really?
There's no work today.
I'd like to go for a swim.
You're older than Tom.
Something made Tom angry.
Stop talking.
Tom insisted.
Everyone loves you.
Get some rest.
Something must be done!
Everything went smoothly.
Apes are intelligent.
Fix this.
Who are you?
That's better.
What would you like to drink?
Crazy!
I think Tom is up to something.
Ready for take-off.
How many books do you have?
Do you like playing basketball?
which scientist said that?
Tell me when you'll call me.
No one believes that he is innocent.
There are some people singing in the lobby.
This is for you.
Are you not a teacher?
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
Tom has an air of mystery about him.
I understand your language.
I used to feel like that.
The committee will meet next Monday.
Tom gave me some books.

Step aside!
Keep warm.

You had to study English.
When would Tom like us to do that?
It will rain tomorrow.
I remember.
Did you see something?
It is unfortunately true.
Do you like France?
Open up.
Tom returned to work on October 20th.
Tom and I used to be the same weight.
What? Did I hear you right?
I never drink.
I've come to talk with you again.
Stand up.
What are you doing?
Are you stupid?
He speaks English well.
You need to blame somebody.
Give me time.
You need to relax.
Tom glanced at Mary.
Tom loved you.
I want to know more about your country.
Tom is kind of weird.
Sami followed Layla to her building.
Please fix it.
They want something to write with.
Tom danced.
You made mistakes.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
We remember.
Nobody talks with him.
That message was sent by Tom.
Somebody came to our house.
Tom hates Halloween.
I can not write.
Stay with me for a moment.
I miss you.
Everybody lies.
Sami looked depressed.
I hope no one saw you.
"What?" "Nothing."
She stopped it.
How many eggs do you usually eat for breakfast?
Mary was laughing at him.
We're both writers.
Tom began to tickle Mary.
Did you see something?
Tom said that he'll come tomorrow.
I'm so happy for you.
She was stoned.
You helped us.
It is I that am bad.
What kind of girls do you like?
I got married on October 20th.
Kill me.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
That happened in October.
I don't understand anything.
Push.
Tom doesn't know how to use the computer.
You're all insane.
We need somebody.
Sami's manager came over and started to yell at him.
I feel tired.
Choose one person.
Why did you do it?
I cried.
Tom walked with Mary.
Tom was standing behind Mary.
Snow is white, but soot is black.
Sami was in Tahiti.
Are you sure Tom is here?
Drive safely.
You are rich.
Tom recommended the novel to them.
He has missed his meal.
Why are you crying?
Where's your God now?
Somebody is following us.
I'm exhausted.
On Monday, I'm going to visit my sister in Boston.
Tom is the coach.
I am blind in the right eye.
Sami and Layla were together for years.
This is difficult.
Somebody's coming.
Stop arguing.
Mistakes happen.
I panicked.
Why are you reading that?
What have you learned, Tom?
Get ready quickly.
Are you sleeping?
I swim here every day.
Does she have a sister?
Something's different.
Tom cooked dinner.
We know you lied to Tom.
Tom is a well-respected man.
He provided us with everything we needed.
Tom is tall.
It seems like we haven't done anything fun since last October.
Djafar was drunk yesterday.
I wouldn't wish this to anybody.
The land became a village.
Go get changed.
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
What're you reading?
Be brave!
Tom died.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
Somebody has ransacked my room.
Tom came.
Tom fainted.
This is a chair.
Tom hates Mary.
The neighbors called the police.
Everybody was really happy.
When is the next flight to Boston?
Please go home.
Do you know how this works?
I don't think you realize how much I miss you.
Just let me in.
Stand by.
Do you like dogs?
Tom is going to law school.
Stay a while.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
One of them.
I know somebody who can help us.
I have everything under control.
I don't know what I did at all.
Did you call?
She swims well.
Look again.
Start!
I can't remember your name.
I am reading Persian.
Tom vomited.
Tom is originally from Australia.
Tom still hopes to do that.
Layla turned the water on.
Australia is an amazing country.
What time do you leave for school?
Tom and I are soul mates.
Seriously?
Tom responded instantly.
Dinner's ready.
This man discerns well.
We hope you'll be back in Boston soon.
Eat fruit.
I couldn't restrain myself.
Help me out.
Apes are intelligent.
I thought you said you didn't want to be disturbed.
The kids are making too much noise.
I teach English.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French very well.
I love reading in bed.
Tom loved you.
He lost a losing battle.
I've always been proud of you.
I have a dog.
I like him. He's a nice person.
Who vanished?
Is Tom available?
Tom's Canadian.
I'll go to Boston in October.
Tom decided.
Your moment has arrived!
Tom studied French.
Give me some milk, too.
Did you read this?
Tell us a ghost story.
Sami has been stalking Layla.
May I suggest another strategy?
Do you like Japanese dishes?
Thank God.
I hope you've learned something from your mistake.
Stay away.
The doctor told Tom he should rest.
Do you know Georgian?
Your time will come.
Tom vanished.
Did anyone tell her?
Oh, hush!
Somebody set the fire.
Step aside.
Do you write in French?
The sky is clear, it is full of stars.
Well, ask!
Sami felt like he knew Layla.
Tom forgot.
This is not yours.
I don't eat rice every day.
Is that a cat?
You must have dropped your phone in your haste to catch the bus.
Tom spent three years in Australia working as a carpenter.
I wish I'd remembered to buy flowers for Mary.
Someone took my place.
Where do you live now?
Get everybody out.
Come outside.
I like reading.
Somebody might stop you.
My doctor is very kind.
Why are you cursing?
They're still following us.
Bon appetit.
Tom kneeled.
Show me your papers!
You're all happy.
Be watchful.
I will sleep.
Lead the way.
I hope no one sees me like this.
A year has twelve months.
Girls are crazy.
I can't go swimming with you tomorrow.
Tom stayed.
I need you to do something.
Whether he is tired or not, the job is waiting for him.
Tom said he'd call tomorrow.
I cut classes.
You are ruined.
Come here.
Tom's family loved Mary.
Red wine, please.
Stop crying.
I watch the evening news while I eat dinner.
Tom has OCD.
Australia is just one of the countries I visited last year.
I hope you've learned something from your mistake.
Won't you read this book?
For all their serious wounds, all of them were in good spirits.
Why do you want all this stuff?
Close it.
You know better than I do.
Do you believe in Christianity?
Tom is unpopular.
Are you stupid?
Identify Tom.
There's always somebody there.
I want to kiss Tom.
Everybody cheered.
You'd better start at once.
You're all racists.
I returned to Boston on October 20th.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
Someone's eating.
Please give me a hand with my job.
I'm not your slave!
Why did you buy it?
Aren't you a little young to be doing this?
Stop whimpering.
Please stop fighting.
We have to keep our eyes open for what is happening.
He's smart.
I don't need you anymore.
Take Tom home.
Tom and Mary are about the same size.
Somebody answered.
My son has become a man.
Please be quiet.
We already gave it to you.
Eat slowly.
Tom is going to eat soon.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
My dog has a very long tail.
I don't eat a lot of fruit.
Have you eaten?
Somebody called Tom wants to see you.
Is it true?
If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Did someone contact you?
She went home.
Give me some milk, too.
Take him away.
I believed you.
He read a lot.
She disappeared.
Somebody did that already.
Tom lacks social skills.
He couldn't finish his dinner.
Tom is young, but he isn't innocent.
Are you wealthy?
It worked.
I can eat whatever I want to.
They're inside.
Please introduce me to a cute girl.
Is somebody here?
I don't have to wear glasses any more.
I'm seeing somebody.
Do you like literature?
I will never forgive you.
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
It will snow tomorrow.
Are you going to go swimming?
Tom opened the door and told Mary John wasn't home.
Are you sick?
Dig a deep hole.
Did somebody mention my name?
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia now.
Tom was there for Mary.
Continue working.
He went to sea to swim.
I'm at a loss for words.
Call the cops.
I eat and drink.
Come.
You see?
Are those your children?
She kicked him.
Breakfast is served between 7 and 9.
Tell Tom that you lied.
You must believe me.
Will she come?
Help me to do it.
Is that good or bad?
It is I that am bad.
Sami was with someone else.
Tom was completely clueless.
You are happy.
Tom appreciates modern art.
What is your objective?
You have only to believe him.
Keep away.
Did Tom come?
Did she check them?
I did almost the same thing that Tom did.
Why did you buy it?
Can you please help me?
Your eyes are lying.
Eat everything you wish.
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
Please come.
Who teaches you French?
Take care of the kids.
I was playing.
Bring her home.
Tom isn't as good-looking as his brother.
You need a good woman.
You are lying.
He is hated.
Tom bought that for us.
Please call him.
Shut the door.
Keep it.
Who among you remembers what happened with us in 2001?
I don't turn thirty until October.
Where did you cook them?
Stop crying.
Tom showed her the letter from Santa Claus.
Let me be.
Who are you?
Do you remember?
Who could take Tom's place?
Somebody has to stop you.
Let me go!
Keep reading.
Tom told me you didn't win.
Tom entered the kitchen.
Why didn't you call somebody?
I love you, too, Tom.
It may have rained during the night.
You can go home now.
We have a lot of food.
Somebody had to do something.
She obeys him.
Go home now.
Stop singing.
Are they friends?
You know the law.
I've checked.
Everybody sang.
When I moved to Boston, I was still in my thirties.
You'd better tell her soon.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
I hate politics.
Tom doesn't talk.
Bring her home.
Tom knows you're lying.
We went swimming in the river yesterday afternoon.
Tom slapped Mary.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom seemed to understand why Mary didn't want to go to Australia with him.
Tom's wife left him in October.
Get lost.
Did someone contact you?
I made you coffee.
Do you need any help, buddy?
Please read that book.
I can't speak another language.
Listen to Tom.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Tom was murdered by Mary.
Thanks, Tom. I'll take it from here.
Let me be.
She is beautiful.
Sami respects his car.
Fix this.
Are you hiding?
I haven't written a letter to anyone in a long time.
Ken makes it a rule to get up early.
She was keeping something from me.
You are mistaken about that.
It's going to rain.
You love dancing.
Perfect!
I wonder why.
Is it the truth?
Tom said he considered doing that.
Tom is sick.
I go shopping every morning.
Have you finished?
I just wanted somebody to help me.
Tomorrow then, we will meet the same time as now in this café.
We were friends.
Sami didn't talk to Layla for like six years.
Draw a straight line.
Someone took my place.
You may not smoke in this room.
We won't know until October 20th.
What exactly do you need to do?
Toughen up!
Try to keep Tom busy.
Stop there.
Write!
He had his car stolen yesterday.
Are you happy?
He has a lot of problems in mind.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
I love you.
Donate blood.
I'll go to Boston sometime before October.
Somebody has to do something.
Stay with me for a moment.
You make me feel dizzy!
I don't know that.
Tom's apartment is really small.
Take cover!
Your daughter's very attractive.
Love has blinded you.
Jim is coming to the party, too.
Roger worked from early in the morning until late at night.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
She slept an hour.
Go and take a cold shower.
I know Tom is a painter.
Has something happened?
Where's your uncle?
The key is preparation.
Dinner is ready to eat.
Hey, relax.
Why doesn't Tom talk?
Welcome home.
Please.
I don't know what you like.
Be patient!
Let's go to a movie tomorrow.
Did you read this?
You don't have to be shy.
Somebody just called.
Are you fucking kidding me?
As if!
The soldier is dead.
Tom is mocking Ken.
My glass is dirty.
Stop fighting!
What are you doing?
The room is a mess.
I'd like to see her back.
I'm drinking a glass of rosé.
Someone made a mistake.
Guess again.
Did you read everything?
Take me home.
You have a very nice smile.
I'll never overlook your mistakes again.
I'll never be rich.
I wanna quit my job.
Please do that.
Come closer.
He reads the newspaper.
Sami handed Layla the bag.
Where are you going this afternoon?
Tom didn't wash his car.
He wrote a letter.
Somebody has to talk.
Come on, talk to me.
Are you expecting someone?
Jaffer betrays his people.
"How are you?" "I can't complain."
Tom and Mary met at a Halloween party.
Sami replies faster on Facebook.
I'd like to see your sister.
It's midnight.
They cheered.
Tom couldn't remember where he hid the map.
Tom put Mary to bed.
Sami has work.
It is raining.
Love has blinded you.
I thought you'd want the work.
Using Linux in your target language is a great way to learn new vocabulary and gain practical experience.
She knows.
Welcome, everyone.
Please get in.
Are you prepared?
Tom took his foot off the gas.
I'm in Tel Aviv.
Your philosophy of life varies from mine.
Won't you read this book?
I did want that to happen.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
Don't forget your phone.
Are they still angry?
We apologize.
Did she check them?
I can't eat all that by myself.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
We all came from space.
You can give me some money?
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
Somebody might've overheard you.
Call me.
Make me a sandwich.
Did you read that?
I was at your wedding.
I overslept.
Are you sure that you have enough money?
Are you ready?
Are you a girl?
Which one do you want, this one or that one?
I brought you some food.
I am crazy about you.
Have you become insane?
Help yourselves. There's plenty more in the kitchen.
I just received your letter.
Are not you ashamed of yourself?
Layla is a pretty girl.
Who is calling, please?
Who was that girl who came with Tafrara?
Do you want to eat something before we leave?
Is someone there?
Did you see her face?
No smoking.
Why did you go to Tokyo?
I will have returned tomorrow.
Tom didn't talk about you.
Did Tom find them?
Somebody just called.
Have you become insane?
Let's try something.
I didn't think you were in Australia.
It's too late to eat now.
Did Tom help his mother yesterday?
Nobody is speaking.
To life!
Tom is wrong.
I've already read this book.
Walk.
I drink coffee with milk.
Can you open the door for me?
I won't be alone.
Take your time.
Please don't tell him.
Tom knows the truth.
Tom and Mary celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary on October 20th.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Fly.
This I have done.
Maybe you should've told Tom the truth.
I'll give you a call before I come.
Can you find it?
Are you mad?
Tom knows the truth.
Did you listen to his new song?
My brothers!
Get everybody out.
The woman reads.
What's the point of patching such a big tear?
Wash your feet.
Follow Tom.
Somebody was talking to Tom.
Did you find your letters?
Please come here.
I want to eat with you.
You returned.
No one moved.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
You run.
I know you're here, Tom.
Nobody here smokes.
You just sit there and wait until Tom gets back.
She stood up.
I'm fully aware of Tom's activities.
That was fabulous.
I have something to give you.
Tom and Mary got married last October.
Where did you give them?
Close your eyes.
She's smarter than me.
Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
Tom loves singing.
All my problems are over.
Stop daydreaming.
Stand up.
Tell Mary I'm looking forward to meeting her.
My fate is in your hands.
See you tomorrow at the library.
Holy shit!
You're all alone.
The internet is not connecting.
Tom is truthful.
Sit down.
Tom didn't come back.
Do you usually eat lunch with your friends?
Do you think Tom likes me?
Sami knows his limits.
Tom came to the door.
You shouldn't go to work.
I regret I didn't tell Tom the truth.
You are crazy.
Did you read it at all?
Tom needs you here.
I think Tom must be thirsty.
What was the name of that little shop in Boston where Tom worked?
This dog eats almost anything.
Tom said that he liked me.
What is the truth?
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
Hello, Tom.
They hate the Algerian authority.
Stop pushing.
I read his book.
Let me out!
Yes, both words have the same meaning.
Now, listen!
Somebody's listening.
Fish lives in rivers and sea.
Are they busy?
Everyone was satisfied.
Do you know about Singapore?
Have some.
Tom got lost.
I can't write anything at all.
I wish he were on our team.
Tell Tom what you need.
Did you listen to his new song?
I was in the mountains.
I'm seriously considering moving to Australia.
You should leave right now.
Tom needs somebody to help him.
Most Hollywood movies have happy endings.
I can't do that now. I'm too drunk.
Tom struggled to keep his eyes open.
Look at my new car.
We found him alive.
Exercise is good for you.
You are not funny.
I'd love that.
Sami asked Layla to do him a favor.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
Tom loves books.
Sami started to really freak out.
Don't believe that anybody will be thankful for it.
Save me!
We wonder why.
Would you come our house?
Is everything OK with you?
Monday's not good.
Without a doubt!
I like wine.
Boston is a great city.
Tom isn't polite.
Slow down.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
He just talks, he don't discern.
Nobody hates you.
Forgive me.
I love you bunches.
Tom put on his jeans and a T-shirt.
Understood.
What happened on October 20?
We don't need to be here.
I know that Tom is courteous.
Who paid?
I have a couple of Canadian friends.
Did you eat anything this morning?
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Watch carefully.
This is for you.
Tell Mary I'm looking forward to meeting her.
Choose carefully.
Don't you have to work tomorrow?
Tom thought that no one saw him.
Love hurts.
Tell Tom what you need.
Cheers!
Where's your God now?
I spoke to the boy who seemed to be the oldest.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Close the window.
You should come visit us!
Please lend me your car.
I hope no one followed you.
I am not concerned with this.
Make it stop.
Jim opens the door.
Tom despised Mary.
Somebody has done that already.
I sure hope this is a dream.
Try to keep her occupied.
Tom will contact Mary.
I coughed.
I was ready for them.
Close your eyes.
Tom said he likes teaching French.
My mother is not at home.
Someone stole my passport.
Do you love me?
Will you really send me a Japanese doll?
I am your father.
He is a singer.
Since it's raining, it would be better if you stayed at home.
Wash the apple before you eat it.
Something wrong?
I am crazy about you.
Immediately!
I know it takes courage to do that.
Mary likes you.
Nobody hates you.
Somebody poisoned me.
Tom didn't trust Mary.
I think that's not true.
The man is old.
I have a little cat called Nina.
Have you read this?
What do you think they should do?
I just don't know what to say.
Something wrong?
There is a knife here.
Tom can wait.
Tom handed a cup of coffee to Mary.
Bob helped me.
Remember last year.
Would you like me to go there with you?
I just can't sleep.
Which of your brothers is the oldest?
Language acquisition requires creativity.
I eat.
I was with Tom last October.
Is today Friday?
You are happy.
Do you know Georgian?
Tom looks young.
Stop dreaming.
Tom has a Canadian wife.
Sami was a very bad person.
They voted.
You're our prisoner.
You can have any you want.
I heard someone whistle.
You are crazy.
I am crazy about you.
Grab him!
Forget English.
This is how I got acquainted with them.
And afterward?
Move quietly.
Do good to those who hate you.
You need rest.
You can't go back there.
I'll come help you.
Is he Japanese?
Somebody broke into Tom's house last night.
Let me see what you've written.
It's not funny.
Is there somebody you want to call?
The one who speakes too much is preparing trouble.
Tom and Mary are thinking about buying a house.
Tom was happy.
Someone is watching you.
Tom loves Australia.
You can take a break.
Tom's died.
I bet you can not even guess what it is!
Stop reading.
Tom resumed reading.
Tom is a high school student.
Please come here.
Somebody knocked on the door.
It smells good!
I hope you understand.
Tom and Mary explained why they were there.
Learn!
They slept.
Yes!
Tom got lost.
When?
We are Kabyle.
Tom brought his brother.
Who owns this truck?
I guess I'll have to leave now.
Tom has been waiting for it.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
Can I have a bite?
I have a kitty called Nina.
Is the book boring?
You danced.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
I don't eat fruit.
Is the work you're doing difficult?
I like telling stories for children.
You have not heard the children.
Who's your favorite writer?
Sami was stranded in a small town.
Are they new?
You'd better not eat too much.
I have a brother who's the same age as you.
They lost.
I won't have to go there alone.
If he tells you to wash, you should rather get dirty.
She loves coffee.
You drove.
Tom is short.
You know that I know.
Both of us were tired.
Do you know my wife?
I remember seeing that movie.
Tom needs somebody to help him.
Will you go?
Come dance!
Have you got the money?
Have you any further questions?
We forgot all about you.
Cheer up!
Dinner is ready to eat.
Why don't you do something?
Sami needed something but he was afraid to ask.
I don't know if Tom is crazy or a genius.
What do you think about the president's speech?
Tom left the country on October 20th.
Try to keep him occupied.
Sami started being interested in someone else.
Don't eat that.
Free the animals from their cages.
I know some of the boys.
Don't lean against the wall.
Tom used to hate Mary.
They're with me.
Tom and I started at the same time.
Stop studying!
Tom used to drink beer.
I won.
Have a nice day.
She slept.
Catch Tom.
They obeyed.
Tom will be late of course.
No one knows.
We have a reservation.
Do you want me to open this now?
Fat chance.
I've been looking all over for you.
Never forget that.
Do you love me?
Hey, relax.
Enough!
That store is closed Mondays.
I have difficulty in French.
Pass me the book.
Sami should stop playing games.
I brought you some food.
The animals were scared by the thunder.
Tom plays the guitar.
Everyone in the class made fun of Tom's new haircut.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
Tom's apartment is really small.
Choose carefully.
He changed his look a lot.
You have to see this film.
Where's this seat?
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Gesundheit!
Do you remember when you did that?
Wake up!
Where do you live now?
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
Go ahead.
Please go.
What language was that?
We were in Boston last summer.
You are formidable!
Somebody had to do that.
I need somebody to help me do this.
Tom is busy.
Do you have any animals?
Tom and Mary are coming right back.
I went to school with him.
The truth hurts.
Where is this money coming from?
He stood there for a while.
You're out of here.
Tom met many other artists when he was in Boston.
Can you reach it?
Tom changed jobs.
I'm not doing this for you.
Ask them.
Read this right away.
How much money do teachers make?
You have to tell him.
I'm scared of cats.
Why shouldn't I eat this?
What's the special today?
They will find them.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom's body hasn't been found.
The police are after us.
Tom's being mean.
Tom likes rock.
Where did you cook them?
I know what I'll do.
Please come here.
Stop worrying.
My stars!
Call your brother.
Exactly.
She is Kabyle.
Only joking.
You look good in black.
Tom and I were roommates for three years.
Are you dressed?
Someone is watching Tom.
You are lucky.
Send me somebody right away.
Hello everybody!
Tom didn't marry Mary.
Everyone agrees.
Just apologize.
We hope many of you will come.
That's what you told me last week.
Somebody stole my car.
You were right.
There is a lot of milk in the jar.
Everybody is afraid.
Tom didn't believe Mary.
Follow me!
Yes, please.
Tom loves building things.
Good night!
They eat these things.
Can art change the world?
You are an idiot!
I think you've been trying to contact us.
Attention!
If there was no understanding, what's friendship for?
Stop crying.
Don't you have something to do?
Tom saw me.
Is something troubling you?
Tom kissed his cat.
No one cared.
Did you see something?
I knew it.
I'm atheist.
Are you human?
I found only three occurrences of the word "woman" in the entire article.
I give you plenty of money each month.
Can you fix this?
Sami went home.
No one understood.
Are you mad?
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with them.
One cup of coffee, please.
You should ask somebody else.
Make it happen.
Sami doesn't know who Layla is.
I saw somebody.
Tom would've understood.
Bring your wallet.
Both of us were tired.
Eat and drink up.
It's a critical situation.
Sami is an asshole.
Someone called Tom.
I want to come to Boston next weekend.
I study for many hours at night.
Why would you ever think so?
I am glad to accept your invitation.
I told them not to tell you.
Somebody had to do something.
Tom's apartment is way too big for just one person.
You make me feel dizzy!
Stop worrying.
What do you really want to say?
Have you seen Tom yet?
When are you planning to leave?
He changed his job.
Drive slowly.
Sing!
Does your sister know how to play piano?
I asked Tom out.
Tom would never hit Mary.
It's dead.
I hear you clear.
I'm computer-literate.
Who ate?
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
This is the first time I've ever bitten my tongue.
I am hungry.
She adores him.
Nobody went there.
You drove.
Quit making fun of me.
Go ahead.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I drive.
Tom drives safely.
I'm going to go out and get us something to eat.
We made it.
Come here quickly.
I want you to sing a song.
She loves you very much.
My mother thinks I'm a liar.
I have a lot of tasks.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Why were you frightened?
How will I find it?
Are you alive?
The boy is nice.
Why did you buy only one banana?
Telephone me if it rains.
May I see that blouse, please?
Pass me the butter, please.
Show it to Tom.
They're asleep.
The other one doesn't work.
This dictionary isn't useful at all.
Somebody took away my bag.
I hope no one saw you.
You are stupid.
Tom did not raise his head.
Nothing happened.
Do you enjoy losing?
Run.
I'm going to Australia next week.
I like art.
I don't want to get my hands dirty.
I spoke to my daughter.
Don't forget to bring your student ID.
Tell Tom I love him.
Are you thirsty?
Just relax.
Are you Canadian?
You made mistakes.
What is that?
I have to meet with Tom.
Talk to somebody.
I lent my umbrella to Tom and Mary.
I love you bunches.
I loved her.
Tom is a talented actor, isn't he?
Anything else?
Who responded?
The grenades are ripe go pick them.
In this shop we sell meat.
You are crazy.
I need someone now.
Where are her other pictures?
Somebody might've overheard you.
Sit!
It's hard to see an orphend crying.
Could you at least give me a hint?
We have to save him immediately.
Speak Italian!
Have you seen the new movie?
She said 'I love you' to me.
There you are.
I'm driving to Boston tomorrow.
I give you plenty of money each month.
Perhaps not.
The question now is who.
Put it on the floor.
I want to talk to you.
Fill up this water bottle, please!
Tom asked me out again.
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
I know you're writing a book.
We're going to get married in October.
Tom is quiet.
They trust you.
Are you funny?
Someone is watching you.
Tom wanted Mary to go home.
You wash the potatoes.
I walked.
Tell everybody.
Should we wait?
He may have absented himself from school the day before yesterday.
Sami's shoes didn't fit Layla.
Don't force yourself to eat if you don't want to.
Someone is watching you.
Tom will alert Mary.
Save her.
I know it takes courage to do that.
On my way home, I met him.
Have you eaten?
Close your book.
Take cover!
The boy injured his hand.
We don't sing.
Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow.
I followed him.
Always have your dictionary near at hand.
Someone is waiting for Tom.
Where did you cook them?
I have a headache.
Where does he live now?
Take care!
Hit Tom.
Whose shoes are these?
I was at your wedding.
She can help you out.
That's what Tom told me last week.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
I love Tom with all my heart.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I hate coffee.
You saw that movie, didn't you?
What if somebody saw this?
Tom wants attention.
How did you find it?
Tom smoked.
Quick!
Maybe you'd better come with us.
I love you bunches.
I want somebody else.
You ought not to call at this time of night.
Tom clapped.
I'll return to Australia on October 20th.
Do you allow me to stay over this night?
Have the children eaten yet?
A Mr Jones has come to see you.
I hope no one followed you.
What papers do you take?
Somebody was talking to Tom.
I love traveling.
Tom asked us to be silent.
Tom lies to me all the time.
Tom said Mary seemed scared.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Did you forget something?
Who died?
It will be too late.
Be reasonable.
I'll arrive on October the twentieth.
You are American.
I don't think Tom knows how to dance.
I can't agree with you on this matter.
Have you lost your reason?
Values melt like snow in the sun!
Someone stole my money.
Somebody has broken this dish.
Tom is standing up.
Each sentence has its syllables' number.
Tom knows Mary's father.
My father smokes.
Elections are scheduled for October.
I want somebody to talk to.
Why were you frightened?
Somebody tried to kill me.
I hear somebody talking.
I thought you would come.
Look closer.
I love rock.
You are so smart!
You speak like your mother.
Thank you for listening.
Sami did not need that.
Leave town.
Dream on!
Brush your teeth clean after each meal.
Go get changed.
Tom lacks experience.
You walk quickly!
Tom said he isn't going to Mary's party.
I want you to come at once.
Good day!
Tom is due to be arraigned on October 20th.
This will keep you warm.
What do you feed your dog?
They come from the same town.
I saw a dog.
I made you coffee.
I don't eat raw fish.
You are teachers.
I believe you like your job.
Somebody has to stop Tom.
Isn't anybody going to swim?
Call security!
Merry Christmas!
Do you know Tom's brother?
Thank you for your call.
You are crazy.
Everybody laughs.
Mary is a dialogue police officer.
He is noisy, but otherwise a very nice boy.
I'm so tired that I don't feel like studying tonight.
Don't forget to tell Tom that he has to do that.
If you eat that, you'll die.
You make me feel dizzy!
How are you doing?
Tom insulted Mary.
Tom doesn't respect Mary.
What subway goes to the center of town?
Follow that car.
I usually go to Boston in October.
I only eat vegetables.
We enjoyed ourselves.
Tom frowned.
Tom's asleep.
Tom's shop opened on October 20th.
Monday comes after Sunday.
You seem very scared.
Where did you get all those keys?
I know only this.
You should sleep.
Tom told Mary to wash her hands.
Tom was killed in October.
It is a small dog.
Tom shouldn't say that to Mary.
Tom is never going to agree to do that.
Whom did you meet?
Just talk with them.
Dry your eyes.
Don't let anyone come near the fire.
Tom tried to resuscitate Mary.
Tom will propose to Mary.
Where did you go swimming?
I'm dying for you.
Yes, two.
Please don't forget what we discussed.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
He changed a few words.
Make another choice.
Why doesn't anybody help Tom?
I can teach you how to cook.
I have to talk to somebody.
Are not you ashamed of yourself?
Tom and the other farmers prayed for rain.
You're after me.
I don't want to live with you.
Nothing lasts forever. The coffee gets cold. The smoke clears. The time passes and the people change.
Freindship is good when there is understanding.
That store is closed Mondays.
Shut up!
France is a republic.
Go.
Tom's hair is black.
He likes taking walks.
We speak French.
Please smile.
No pain, no gain.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Somebody's singing.
You speak.
You can have any you want.
Get your carcass out of here!
What, again?
Tom realized Mary was following him.
Who succeeded?
Do you know how far Boston is from Chicago?
I'll call on you on Monday.
Tom's house is very close to mine.
Awesome!
I suppose you like him.
They yelled.
Happy holidays.
He bought it.
He is boasting in front of us.
We want something new.
Tom used to date Mary.
Didn't you know there was a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
Contact Tom.
Keep looking.
Tom felt tired.
I forgot all about that.
When I run, I get sweaty.
It looks like you are from India.
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
She built it.
Tom is exactly the same age as Mary.
Get up.
Tom was interested in Mary.
Call me when you land.
What's your problem?
I'll tell you the truth.
You are an idiot!
They're using you.
They ate.
She grew roses.
Did someone die?
Whose is it?
What makes you think Tom hasn't done that yet?
Can somebody answer that?
Nobody wants to work.
They're asleep.
You have no idea.
Tom gave Mary John's number.
Goodnight!
He was outraged.
I like winter.
Tom said I needed to study French.
I'm comfortable now.
You are so tall!
You lied to me.
I miss Tom a lot.
I'm sure that I'll be able to do that.
I told Tom to get there early.
Clean the room.
I don't know how to cook.
It happened on Halloween night.
Let her go!
No one's in there.
I stayed home.
Examine this.
Keep moving.
I missed you very much.
Tom walked away from Mary.
Did Tom say anything to you before going out?
You're home too?
You are envious.
April fools!
Running is a good sport.
Tom doesn't know that I'm hungry.
Tom and Mary used to live in Boston.
You should just stay here.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
Sami ran out to the hallway.
Is somebody there?
Stop arguing.
What time are you planning to leave?
Some computer.
Shit.
The man rode a horse.
Tom's face was pale.
Truth prevails.
He speaks four languages.
Tom scolded Mary.
He writes poems.
Have you lost your reason?
Ask Alex.
You don't have to leave.
Stop lying to me.
You make me feel dizzy!
Let's meet again on October the 20th.
Sami began to realize that.
Get up!
He is corrupt.
He kissed her.
My legs hurt after the long walk.
You seem very scared.
Construction started in October.
I fainted.
Do you come back from Tibet?
Watch the road.
Buy!
I love summer.
I want to eat lunch now.
You can't stop us.
I hope to see you again the next time you're in Australia.
Tom won the Nobel prize.
Could somebody get me a spoon?
Take care!
Are you stuck?
He wants to go to Africa.
Somebody tried to kill me.
They are crazy.
I will give him the book tomorrow.
Many teachers have a problem with Tom.
Please answer in French.
Tom said that he had no intention of leaving Boston.
We'll send somebody.
Today was fun.
Tom has no choice but to stay.
You are foolish.
Tom gave a cup of coffee to Mary.
You can change that if you want.
I love you better than he.
I love her.
Please call me at six tomorrow morning.
You had better have your hair cut.
Tom sent you something.
His girlfriend wants to go for a walk this morning.
No one knows.
You befooled me.
Leave everything.
Can you speak Indonesian?
Did you read it?
Somebody laughed.
Are you asleep?
My hope is gone, I do not know where it is.
I don't think like you.
Drink some tea.
Somebody has stolen my suitcase.
Can you also speak French?
He will come to you tomorrow.
Probably.
So, why are you here?
Tom said Mary seemed scared.
Can you please show me the photo?
I use it.
Will you permit us to leave now?
Sit tight.
Respect yourself.
I learned that from you!
What're you thinking?
Don't move.
Do you want to go to the station with me?
She assembles computers.
Go warm up.
Put it on the floor.
Fuck you!
Have another.
I kissed him.
Sami told this to his doctor.
Winter is approaching.
What else can you do?
English is spoken by about a billion people.
Layla was a snobby bitch.
Why do you want all these?
I need someone to help me.
Follow us.
Check, please.
Tom waved goodbye to Mary.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
How beautiful!
Do you prefer eating out or eating at home?
You have many friends.
Somebody wants to send a message.
We've all missed you.
I'd love to go out with you.
I have no patience.
Why didn't you call somebody?
Loosen up.
Who invited you to the party?
Tom tried to kiss me.
The jar is empty.
Tell Tom that I don't want to go.
Pass me the potatoes.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Somebody's watching us.
Have you already read this?
It's up to you.
Tom slapped Mary.
Tom sings.
Be prepared!
Close your eyes.
She loves you very much.
Go warm up.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
Are you human?
Tom saw it.
When will Tom return home?
Do you think I talk too much?
She can speak Japanese.
Do you intend to eat all that?
Tom went to Boston at the end of October.
Can you open the door for me?
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
He drinks coffee.
I don't remember.
I read a letter.
We watch television.
This hat is from Australia.
Water, please.
Say it clearly.
She loves you very much.
Hit me.
That book is very old.
Tom needs a dozen eggs.
Isn't that why Tom and I are here?
No Smoking!
Who succeeded?
Somebody is lying here.
Look at my new car.
hold that chair.
Thanks, everyone.
Tom cursed.
Nobody asked you.
Try!
Are you single?
I got somebody to help me do that.
I didn't lie. You did.
Tom said he liked studying French.
Tom called Mary.
Tom knew Mary was following him.
Sami's father was a Muslim.
You sound surprised.
Will someone tell me what has happened here?
You are German?
Somebody poisoned me.
Sami put the quarters in that slot machine.
Be punctual.
Tom felt lucky.
Let him do it.
Sami liked doing this.
Only God knows.
I don't want your pity.
I want that book, please.
I can eat.
I know that Tom is unmarried.
Please be quiet.
Be patient lady, he will not be long to arrive.
We've lived in Boston three years.
You drink water.
Get ready quickly.
Nothing changes.
The water is not fit to drink.
I still love Tom.
I wasn't here in October.
Someone attacked Tom.
Tom never talked about you.
Tom is intoxicated.
I hope you understand.
Just a minute.
We're going to do it again.
Slowly!
I've been looking all over for you.
You can use my computer if you want.
Poppycock.
I think it's good for you to read this book.
Tom turned green with envy.
Whom do you expect?
I love this sentence.
Tom went to a Halloween party.
Tom teaches French.
I like sleeping.
Tom speaks slowly.
Somebody's watching you.
You're wet through.
Settle down!
Have you read this book already?
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
They are crazy.
Why don't you eat beef?
Nothing is happening.
He cried.
Nobody died.
We know.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
We'll stay with him.
Anything new?
Tom means nothing to me.
They ate hot peppers.
Don't punish Tom for that.
Mary is a smart lady.
Please don't touch the flowers.
Are you fucking kidding me?
We heard the door open.
Where are you?
I'm not doing this for you.
My garden is small.
Bring me my glasses.
Sami and Layla were arguing about a fucking three-dollar coupon.
I need to stay in Australia until the day after tomorrow.
Why didn't you call somebody?
I have to visit Tom.
How long have you studied?
Follow your dreams.
I bought a pair of earrings.
See you tomorrow at the library.
Is she going to remember me?
I know that I can count on you.
Who cheered?
You see?
Take time to eat your meals.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
You fell.
They paid separately.
Sami is only a year older than me.
Some of what you said sounded stupid.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
Kill!
Sami's friend passed away.
Tom told me he likes you a lot.
Tom never offered a reason why.
That was amazing.
You aren't the only one Tom has cheated.
Somebody did that already.
Do both Tom and Mary understand French?
She prayed.
For you?
That's your slave, right?
Have you read the whole book?
Tom got sleepy.
Come over.
People like spring.
What happened here?
Back off.
Somebody might stop you.
I didn't think Tom would be so tired.
Work!
Hit me.
When would you like to eat?
He is Kabyle.
They don't seem happy.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
Where's your grandmother?
We're not going to take a nap.
Today is Friday.
Tom swam.
Tom told me that he didn't speak French.
Jim resembles his father.
Let's leave before Tom and Mary get here.
How much cheese did you eat?
I remember seeing that movie.
Who vanished?
I understand her, but on the other hand I don't think she's right.
Get dressed.
You should take advantage of this chance.
It started to rain as soon as we started eating.
Tom is slated to return in October.
She is dead.
You are reading.
Are you afraid of horror movies?
Is it true that Tom is going to Boston?
The window to the world can be covered by a newspaper.
Somebody wants to kill me.
Someone took my place.
It was pretty.
They are very cheerful.
Nobody laughed.
The pen I'm holding now is not yours.
She doesn't love me anymore.
Tom became friendly with Mary.
The floor gave in under the weight of the heavy safe.
Tom said he'll come tomorrow.
I finished the work yesterday.
Tom can't hear Mary.
Tom is an art student.
Do you remember?
Eat something.
I'm reading his books.
You can change that if you want.
I left.
The apple is ripe.
I should've paid more attention in class.
I trust him.
Tom and I'll always be friends.
Tom is a grouch.
Tom will obey.
Your big sis will show you.
By the way, you can all call me Tom.
Please don't leave me.
Tom didn't like what Mary did.
Eat me.
I can't see well.
Watch your language.
I'm not hungry.
I followed him.
Are you lying?
The dog is dying.
Have you had an answer?
I love you better than he.
They're empty.
Just let me go.
Tom and Mary were married in October.
I'll give you something to eat.
Tom speaks.
You were at home yesterday, weren't you?
Sami drank Layla's urine.
You like tigers.
Stop worrying.
Hello, Lisa.
Tom said he didn't know the rules.
Somebody say something.
I'm not interested in your religion.
Just go and ask Tom.
I think I'm in love with Tom.
There's nothing in here.
Tom lived in Australia.
This chair is very comfortable.
They're fearless.
Have you any idea what you've done?
Sami didn't cry at the funeral.
Keep climbing.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Do you come back from Tibet?
I have things to do tomorrow.
Tom worked closely with Mary.
Somebody tried to kill Tom.
Are you single?
Tom went to help Mary.
Don't force yourself to eat if you don't want to.
Everybody knows.
Tom might help us today.
Thank you, I finally understand.
Tom has gone to Australia.
Just kidding.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
I teach.
Goodnight, Timmy.
Tom left on October 20th.
Hurry up.
I wanted somebody to talk to.
Can this be it?
I told Tom I was married.
Get back here.
There is little hope.
She built it.
Whose is this bag?
Do you trust Tom?
Is it still far from here?
When will you leave?
Tom was nice to Mary.
The day before yesterday we arrived at Osaka.
Come aboard.
Tom says he'll go to Boston in October.
Did you accomplish your purpose?
I want you to stand up.
I sell computers.
He will come to you tomorrow.
I was born to love you.
You only have to call Jean.
I enjoy reading books.
Get everybody out.
I agree.
Tom isn't likely to go to Boston with Mary.
You don't have brown eyes.
She is very beautiful.
How did you find me?
I had my money stolen.
Someone is watching.
Enjoy.
Tom didn't hear Mary.
I've already told Tom I plan on staying in Australia for three more weeks.
Go find Tom.
Snow fell in large flakes.
Slowly!
Everybody wins!
Read!
Add me more of work as long as I'm enthusiastic.
You walk quickly!
How do you vent your anger?
You see?
Stop pushing.
Do you want to eat now or later?
How beautiful!
You're never going to find it.
What were you doing today?
Who's speaking?
I hope we're not bothering you.
Stop singing.
There is a time for everything.
Did you forget?
Where did he go?
The cat is safe.
Louder, please.
Anything else?
I can eat wherever I want to.
What is your age?
Farmers separate good apples from bad ones.
Be cool.
Religion is the opiate of the masses.
Please stop.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary hated him.
How do I explain it?
Are you unlucky?
I'm going to go.
Anton Szandor Lavey founded the Church of Satan.
Please pass me the butter.
Tom was embarrassed.
I'll go.
You'd better not eat too much.
You're a hypocrite.
I need a computer.
Have you no shame?
Tom said that he couldn't remember anything.
Did you want something?
They disappeared.
Everyone giggled.
Stop daydreaming and come down of your tree!
I'm not going to let this happen.
Did Marika talk much about Japan?
Call them.
That's the story.
Tom didn't remember Mary.
Tom is the kind of man I like.
Bob helped me.
Work slowly.
He didn't stop talking.
I stayed.
Can't you do anything to stop them?
Everything that I said is true.
Naomi is very glad about having won first prize.
I'm broke.
Tom has done a great job for us.
I followed him.
This letter isn't addressed to you.
I met Tom this October.
No one spoke.
He lost all the money he had.
Tom is deranged.
We don't think that's true.
I am not concerned with this.
Today was fun.
Fight!
I almost kissed Tom.
Why don't you go outside and play?
Your letter made me happy.
Washing is my work.
I know it's Tom's call.
Anyone can say that.
You can't eat now.
Somebody has to talk.
Does Tom have a black car?
I will go swimming tomorrow.
They escaped.
I want to know who called.
Listen carefully.
Somebody called.
I don't know whom you want to see.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
He is going to destroy the economy.
You'd better go back home now.
Where are your sons?
Give it back!
I need somebody to talk to.
Do you want to tell her?
You befooled me.
Tom didn't help Mary.
Fallen rocks blocked the way.
I only have one question.
I didn't have much fun in Australia.
I sat down next to him.
Slowly, please.
Aren't you going to join me?
I suppose you like him.
What is your age?
What's the weather like in Boston?
I'd like to see your sister.
You are taller than I.
Where will you be on October 20th?
I have to tell Tom the truth tomorrow.
Tom doesn't know I know.
These books are ours.
Tom likes to talk about golf.
Don't be afraid; nothing will happen to you as long as you are next to me.
Tom needs someone to help him.
Tom is very likely to want to go with you.
You will speak Swedish.
Tom wanted to poison Mary.
Somebody poisoned them.
Look ahead.
Mary was gorgeous.
Do you know a certain Mr. Green?
I want you to work with them.
That sounds great.
I didn't expect you to love me.
You speak like your mother.
Tom asked me to do that for Mary.
Save yourself.
Please! Please!
Why are you looking at Tom?
That's not happening till October 20th.
When do you want me to call you?
Why did you call?
Do you like Germany?
Birds fly.
We really enjoyed that.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom gave his key to me.
I know Tom is a billionaire.
Give Tom a kiss for me.
Somebody should do something.
Wait right here.
Don't give Tom too much credit.
The two of us are so different.
The boy eats snakes.
Somebody poisoned him.
What time are you planning to leave?
This will cost €30.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
Are you shy?
Your eyes are lying.
Please come.
Tinhinane loves Amayas.
The dog is dying.
Somebody killed Tom.
Ask Alex.
You are ill.
You can use my computer if you want.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
Ask Alex.
The government oppressed the people.
We went swimming in the river yesterday.
Be attentive.
Tom was talking to Mary.
No one can forgive them.
Tom only spoke French.
Now I recognize you!
My wife is having a baby.
Once more, please.
I need somebody to help me.
What happens now?
I'm hungry!
I want to hold your hand.
I was about to go out when the phone rang.
Will these wounds heal?
I should like to go with you.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?
I'm illiterate.
Somebody had to do it.
I love studying languages.
Many people had no homes at all.
Tom doesn't speak French as fluently as you do.
Why were you wearing a jacket?
Good for you.
Are you writing a letter?
We have less than three hours.
Be tolerant.
I live in Yerevan.
Who talked?
You wash the potatoes.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Somebody stole my lunch.
No, thank you. I'm full.
You'll find somebody.
I usually go to bed before ten.
Are you listening?
She disliked him.
Tell me something about him.
I'll call you within a week.
Think again.
Get changed.
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
I want something else to eat.
He ate a dog.
Do you watch TV every day?
Tom and I want the same thing.
We forgot.
Ahmed is a jealous person.
No pain, no gain.
Welcome to Australia.
Somebody just called.
Tom and Mary are worried about you.
Tom loved you.
I gave Tom a job.
How would you like your eggs?
Somebody has to do something.
I want you back today.
When was the last time you dyed your hair?
Tom is a bad guy.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
How many?
Somebody has to talk.
He plays the guitar well.
How do you vent your anger?
Perfect!
How lucky.
Who do you think is better at French, you or Tom?
Tom is likely to do that, isn't he?
Put more salt in the soup.
I don't think Tom is slow.
You're mocking me.
I forgot your number.
I will do all I can for you.
Keep your clothes clean.
Tom knew I wasn't going to win.
I wish it were always like this.
Aim higher.
Let them help you.
I love her.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to look after him.
Could you drive Tom home?
I have money.
Don't lean against the wall.
Next year I'm going to America.
This way.
I hope to see you again.
You won't make mistakes.
Tom never kisses his wife anymore.
I don't like raï music.
I hope no one sees you like this.
You should come visit us!
Tom is waiting for you to help him.
She is a woman, not a girl.
Close your book.
Keep your hands off my bike!
No, Dad!
Tom fed the pigeons.
How did you do in your exam?
Don't tell anyone.
Did you call?
No one ate the cake.
When did they go?
Please give me a ring this evening.
I took this picture in Boston on October 20th.
