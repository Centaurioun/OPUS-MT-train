Somebody has ransacked my room.
Tom contacted Mary.
I'm hungry like the wolf.
Just leave me alone.
No, I'm afraid not.
That way!
Who yelled?
I'll follow you.
Check that.
Tom is smart.
Don't look at me like that.
Registration starts the twentieth of October.
You're always together.
She is wrong.
I almost drowned.
Somebody stole it from me.
Mine's bigger than yours.
You're after Tom.
I came by myself.
Just leave it.
Are you going to leave me?
Someone is watching.
Young people of nowdays are smart.
His mother is worried sick about him.
I got connected to facebook, to chat some matters with my friends.
Follow my advice.
He studies computational linguistics.
Will you keep your word or not?
He stood there for a while.
I'm undressing.
That won't happen.
Someone is lying.
I don't often eat bananas.
No kidding.
I went, too.
Meqqran is sitting with Tanina in one table.
Dig a deep hole.
Are you expecting someone?
I forgot my pen on the table.
I like rock.
They didn't say anything.
Tom confessed.
Are you crazy?
Somebody has to go first.
Give it to whomever you like.
Tom puts sugar in his coffee, but I prefer mine without it.
Away with you!
Are you expecting somebody?
What would you all like to eat?
Tom has good days and bad.
Everybody is fine.
I shouldn't have trusted them.
Sami recognized that person's face.
They hugged.
I hope to be back in October.
I'm sorry that you lost.
The battery is dead.
Are you Chinese?
Dream on!
Say that again.
I am happy to see you again.
I'm now busy writing a book.
You look like you're certain.
Understand?
Someone stole my watch.
Tom wants something different.
I can't dance.
The severely injured man was dead on arrival at the hospital.
I don't want to miss that.
People are friendly in Australia.
Maybe you'd better come with us.
Meqqran likes reading.
Stop Tom.
She might come.
Where are they taking him?
They'll do what I tell them to do.
Years passed.
Stop talking.
Let me go!
Is anyone hurt?
Stop arguing.
Tom felt weak.
Are you nuts?
Tom has a friend in Australia.
The exhibit runs through October 20th.
He hated lying.
Look behind you.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
Did you forget something?
Are you OK?
We'll walk one behind the other, one next to the other, so we'll have our rights.
Somebody might've overheard you.
Tom was right.
Tom isn't going to be back until October.
Nobody remembers.
Don't forget to take a camera.
Tell me something about him.
You like your Kabyle language.
Somebody called Tom wants to see you.
Have you already decided what you're going to order?
Tom would cry.
Tom quit smoking.
Why are you telling me this nonsense.
Hold still.
Who knows?
Let me be.
We eat.
Tom looked surprised.
You run.
I won't discuss this with her.
She gives instruction in English.
Where am I?
What does she have?
Things break.
This is for you.
He provided us with everything we needed.
Stop shouting.
Millie is eating bread.
What is your age?
The book is too expensive.
Who wrote this sentence?
I hope you've learned something from your mistake.
Somebody might've overheard you.
I don't love Tom.
I'm originally from Australia.
Why are you sitting there?
Are these books yours or mine?
Tom knows.
Hokkaido lies in the north of Japan.
They disappeared.
We agree.
Did you call?
October 20th was a hot day.
I never forgot you.
Are you tall?
All of my children were born in Boston.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I did my best to persuade Tom to do that.
Go find somebody who can help.
There's always somebody there.
Somebody has to talk.
Exhausted with fatigue, I crashed like a log on my bed.
I wanted to love Tom.
I'm tired of your complaints.
Tom ate quickly.
I'm a nurse.
Did you forget something?
Did you read it all?
Have you found something?
I stay home.
Don't lean against the wall.
I think that Tom is truly decent.
Why don't you sit down? The place is free.
Tom shaved.
Tom wanted to protect Mary.
Layla's bridesmaids were her best friends.
We're planting seeds.
Why do people go to the movies?
I live in Yerevan.
Sami's girlfriend was a snobby bitch.
Bring help.
Look behind you.
You are going to speak Swedish.
Jim was able to hold back his anger and avoid a fight.
Coming soon.
Do you remember that store?
Who's your favorite writer?
I'll give you my car.
Jump.
Look closely.
Sami and Layla were not that close.
We didn't eat dinner.
They say that Tom's going to come back.
You are an idiot!
How did we get into this situation?
Get down!
Forget Tom.
Do you want food?
I didn't know you had a cat.
Tom didn't tell me why I shouldn't do that.
You ought not to have spent so much money on that.
Who ate?
I hear somebody talking.
May I go home now?
You still don't like Tom, do you?
She expects us to help her.
At first, Tom seemed OK.
This is my opinion, not yours.
What time is it now in Boston?
Put your room in order.
Are you angry?
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
Forget it!
You aren't the only one Tom has cheated.
Did you want something?
Close the window.
Tom spoke to the crowd.
What're you reading?
Obviously.
Hello.
Tom will sit here.
How many books did you read?
Tom told me he had no enemies.
I feel very lonely these days.
I'm getting married in October.
Sami came home from class.
Are you lying?
The car he bought is black.
I apologize.
Enjoy your vacation.
Did someone say something?
What are you going to do?
Anyone home?
I missed you very much.
Sami didn't know what to say to Layla.
This is going to be fabulous.
I'll arrive on the 20th of October.
It happened last October.
I saw Tom sitting at his desk, reading a book.
Tom and Mary explained why they were there.
Stop it.
Were you surprised to see her?
That's me.
I do like you.
It looks like you are from India.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
We suspected him of lying.
Please give me a hand with my job.
Just let me go.
Away with you!
Tom said he needs to get some air.
He wanders.
To us!
Someone is calling you.
Tom went looking for Mary.
Do you think anyone can see me?
You ought not to have spent so much money on that.
I'll give you a ring on today.
She is learning how to drive a car.
He knocked his brother about.
How do you take your coffee?
Stop him.
Tom did a great job.
Tell me what's wrong.
The woman to whom you were talking is my sister.
Are you teachers?
They say that she quit her job.
Hurry up, Tom.
Somebody had to do it.
Are you thirsty?
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Did they check her?
Where are the newspapers?
Tom sat just in front of Mary.
Tom tried to stab Mary.
Clean your room.
Someone is watching Tom.
He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.
When do I get there?
Would you like to go fishing with me this weekend?
Tom said we should wait here.
Keep reading.
I am glad to accept your invitation.
You did what you had to do.
We're lucky to have Tom working for us.
Please step aside.
Tom refused to eat lunch.
I saw somebody.
I hope you understand.
God is.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Wash up.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
Tom was mentored by Mary.
Can I have it?
Welcome to Canada!
Mary tricked Tom.
Who stopped?
We're talking about Tom.
We'll get to Boston before it gets dark, I think.
Tom and Mary were scared.
Have you lost your reason?
What's your dad's name?
You're all alone.
Are you writing a letter?
My youngest brother was brought up by our grandmother.
Because he is there.
Open your books!
I gave him what little money I had with me.
Shake my hand.
Wash your feet.
Cain killed Abel.
Look back!
I smoked.
Give my best regards to your parents.
Sami wanted to do something.
Never mind that.
Listen well to what I say.
The one for whom I gave myself so much harm, now he wants to make me blind.
You see?
I looked.
Look at this.
Tom barely recognized Mary.
Remember!
Throw it away now, it took all the place.
Where will you be in October?
Be fair.
Sami never stopped talking about his ex.
Are you waiting for someone to come?
I've decided I'll do that instead.
I'll talk to them about it.
I made my decision.
Tom said Mary was unlikely to cry.
You win!
Are you German?
Stop singing.
Do you want to tell her?
Tom groaned.
I used to like swimming.
Everybody hates Tom.
You cannot use his.
Please don't tell him.
Let's ask her something else.
Tom contacted Mary.
Tom returned home.
Jaffer betrays his people.
Lidia, can you cook some food to Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
Can somebody give me a hand here?
Taste this.
Are you new?
Aim higher.
You're not sleeping enough.
I wasn't told.
Are you married?
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Tom is crying.
Thinking is good before jumping.
You did everything?
Someone's talking.
Did someone die?
Are you coming?
Tom ate a huge bowl of spaghetti.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Do you know what you're doing?
Someone is watching you.
No one is answering.
April fools!
Stop arguing.
I study French.
We think this will work well.
Save us.
She writes poems.
I'm not the person you think I am.
You're all racists.
Tom said doing that would be safe.
My pleasure.
Do you know Tom's brother?
Don't talk!
You are jealous.
I'm eating bread.
Tom frowned.
Help us.
Sami wasn't going to stop.
Stop them!
In other words, Tom lied.
Smoke appeared.
Tom broke my heart.
I swear that's all I want.
I find you very boring.
You're all alone.
Don't you think you'll be able to solve the problem by yourself?
Buying an apartment is both exciting and scary.
Do you have diarrhea?
I don't know where I am.
Don't eat to excess.
Speak slowly!
Show it to Tom.
We must die sooner or later.
How I have missed you!
What are we gonna do???
Ask them.
Ignore him.
Could you pass me the water, please?
Always have your dictionary near at hand.
This stinks.
Take this table away.
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
Tom told me he saw somebody kissing Mary.
He drinks a lot of milk every day.
My parents are dead.
Do you speak French?
Hang on.
Nice dress.
Hang on!
Tell Tom.
Please give me a hand with my job.
Are you going?
Where are those boys from?
Start here.
My mother is beautiful.
Someone stole my wallet.
You have to see this film.
Are you sad?
Tiriza is a portuguese name.
Tom resigned on October 20th.
Do that!
I'll find a way.
Get out!
What are you going to do with that?
Maybe Tom needs to do that, too.
Are you funny?
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Memorize the poem by next week.
Are you OK?
Have you ever worked with them?
Are you Catholic?
Look at this.
I'm sure you'll like her.
You are afraid.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
He knows a lot of people.
Toughen up!
Somebody's here.
You're a very good student.
Sami was looking for his daughter.
Fasten your seatbelts.
Tom took a cold shower.
Sami was adopted into a loving home.
Somebody has to go first.
Are you expecting someone?
They must be carefull.
I turned right.
You're a very good student.
Tom needs somebody to help him.
He cannot play guitar.
Chapeau!
Tom goes to Boston once a year.
Tom likes traveling.
I didn't lie. You did.
You pig!
I won't leave early.
Are you talking?
All right, give me a kiss.
How awful!
Open the door.
Starvation does not give food.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I don't think I'll be able to eat all this.
Nobody lied.
Tom was asking for it.
This conference is good.
Sami saw Layla leave Walmart.
Help us.
I won!
I am dead tired.
This dress is too big for me.
My grandfather is sick.
Sami hated Layla from day one.
Did Tom work for you?
I'm thirsty.
Tom and Mary sat way in the back.
Somebody's watching us.
How old is your grandfather?
Get your carcass out of here!
Stop reading.
You look beautiful today.
I am a policeman.
Where's the rope?
Sami told me you were in the kitchen.
Someone stole my watch.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Do you like to be alone?
Tom's alive.
Ready for take-off.
Tom vowed to rescue Mary.
Tom has a new hobby.
Do you smell something?
She is talking.
Tom called on Mary to express his sympathy.
There are around 10 million Kabylians in the world.
Be watchful.
Tom was murdered on October 20, 2013.
Our teacher hates his students to ask questions while he is giving a lecture.
Tom likes to drink beer.
Tom pitied Mary.
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Thank you, I finally understand.
I love you bunches.
Tom will likely be back by October 20th.
Naomi shifted her bag from one hand to the other.
You simply have to call Jean.
Be vigilant.
Somebody has ransacked my room.
Sami was talking to another girl.
Achoo!
Be vigilant.
I need the truth.
I didn't actually do what Tom said I did.
Tom boiled an egg.
Tom is unmarried.
What will you do back in Boston?
Somebody will do that.
My hand itches.
You helped us.
Do you drink beer or wine?
Are you ready?
Tom has told me so much about you.
Are you employed?
Did you take these pictures in Australia?
Ladies first.
I have an idea for a novel.
Tom's awake.
Tom has told us so much about you.
Tom asked me out.
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
Tom blushed.
I left Australia on October twentieth.
Please, where are you from?
God doesn't exist.
Faster!
I don't like eating alone.
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary.
They're not dead.
From now on, let's only speak French to each other.
Yes?
You are weak.
Don't leave me alone.
I'm not talking about her.
Send me there.
You're very different from us.
I didn't like my first French teacher.
We'll have to do something.
You shall have my car.
This boy sleeps a lot.
Nothing changed.
I just need my own space.
I heard someone scream.
This is your last question?
Can you please help me?
Tom threw the apple to me.
They are Kabyle.
I am only joking.
I suspect Tom and Mary are upset.
No Smoking!
Tom smiled.
They're armed.
Good dog!
Sami was looking at the phone.
You fool, I had to do it!
Nobody cares who you are.
Please don't get angry.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
Someone is watching you.
Do you have any friends?
Can you take me to the airport, please?
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
Tom seems to be very rich.
Take everything.
Somebody set the fire.
Tom lives on the west side of Boston.
Stop apologizing.
You were really annoyed with Mary.
Tom hasn't been home since October.
All right.
True art is theft.
Where did you swim yesterday?
We wonder why.
It rained during the night.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Please telephone him.
Are you Japanese?
Snow is falling.
Is someone there?
This house isn't very big.
I thought you couldn't read.
Hang in there, Tom. You're doing fine.
How did you find it?
Have you vomited yet?
Tom always greets his neighbors.
I will come with you.
You make me feel dizzy!
Do you like dogs?
Somebody's listening.
How is the weather today?
I don't think that that was Tom.
I was told not to do that.
Sami was extremely nervous.
I'm not in love with her.
Slow down.
Just let me see it.
They didn't say anything.
Somebody is following us.
How many people are you expecting?
Are you ready?
Did somebody say something?
Try to keep Tom busy.
You're after me.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Probably not.
Day breaks.
I hate soccer.
Why are you reading this?
What the heck are you doing here?
Join us.
Aren't you surprised to see me?
Sami was very nervous and scared.
Stop squabbling.
You drive me nuts!
Tom's answer surprised Mary.
You should be talking to Tom.
I coughed.
Are you nuts?
Tom probably could help you on Monday.
They slept.
Sami greeted the customers.
Write Tom.
Your cat is black.
"Is it true?" "I think so!"
Have you become insane?
It's spring.
Join us.
You will regret this.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Watch carefully.
Tom broke up with Mary.
I must study.
I can't hear it.
Let's get something to eat on the way home.
I envy you your success.
I am not hungry.
I'm breast-feeding my baby.
Wait outside.
Someone scratched my car.
You should eat breakfast every day.
I remember posting your letter yesterday.
Take your time.
Isn't that just a myth?
When is your birthday?
Take medicine.
Can I do anything to help them?
Tom knew.
I'll be in Australia until October 20th.
Tom left in early October.
Sami got annoyed.
That's never happened to me before.
She already knew the answer.
I just received your letter.
Shut up!
I'll write to Tom.
I'm sure that I'll be able to do that.
You are mistaken if you think he is wrong.
Someone is watching you.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
Ask me anything!
Keep out!
It's getting darker and darker.
I will not wait forever.
Tom went with Mary.
Have you forgotten your money?
They're asleep.
Where is the pen?
Summer is over.
Nobody can convince me otherwise.
I hope no one sees me like this.
I won!
Tom's deaf.
We lived in Boston for a long time.
Sami started telling the story.
Everyone loves puppets.
Your hands are stained with blood.
Come eat!
Coffee, please.
She smiled.
Hi, everybody.
Does truth matter?
Sami told them to stop.
Are you Canadian?
Can I pay online?
Can I go outside?
I know Tom is a millionaire.
Please speak French.
It rained.
Pass me the book.
Did you read this?
Do you speak Latin?
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
Come and see me.
Tom told me Mary wasn't thirsty.
That's a beautiful sword.
You can use my computer if you want.
I can do what I want.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
I grew up in Australia.
Follow that car.
She always smiles at me.
Somebody might stop me.
I'm just happy I'm back.
Choose any flowers you like.
My desk is old.
Jaffer betrays his people.
Layla hated Sami.
They smoke.
Something happened to Tom.
You should apologize.
Marvellous.
Tom chucked the apple to me.
Send Tom to me.
Tom watches Mary.
The top execs are gathering for a power breakfast.
Help me!
Defend yourselves.
She is having dinner now.
You can use this dictionary.
I'm not completely sure.
Tom's plane is landing right now.
Go find somebody who can help.
Are Kabyle women beautiful?
Watch what you eat.
Let me be.
I'm reading.
Do you speak like the Italians?
Somebody's singing.
I'll play the guitar for you.
Tom and I think alike.
Will it snow tonight?
I'm glad you waited for me.
A language is never foreign.
Be tolerant.
Please do as I say.
Tom would have approved.
He is anxious about his future.
Are you there?
Do you smell something?
I'm dying for you.
I didn't know you had a cat.
Thanks again.
I promised Tom that I'd wait for him.
Why do you want all this stuff?
Keep digging.
I have a big family.
You're a lie.
What are your hobbies?
Tom is visiting Australia.
Are you excited?
Do you see the star?
Can you stop yelling?
Tom's father walked out on his family.
Is it time you need?
I can't agree with you on this matter.
I'm sure Tom would agree.
Doing that didn't make Tom happy.
The man is old.
Do you want food?
Liar!
Somebody tried to kill Tom.
Can I eat that orange?
I love you.
I'll buy you something to eat.
Everyone's dead.
You're never going to find it.
Stop singing.
Did you call him yet?
You can go home now.
They're sick of hearing from me.
You're a problem.
Why don't you go to Tom's house?
Tom smirked.
We took a back road to avoid the heavy traffic.
His idea is superior to yours.
Tom slammed the door angrily.
I take it that you know how to do that.
A Mr West called in your absence.
Have you become insane?
That house is very small.
Stop grumbling.
Tom can go with us tomorrow.
Please telephone him.
Try some.
Are you hiring?
Don't wait.
Love has ended.
Stop singing.
Are you hungry?
You have to encourage him to become a teacher!
Where are you?
Tom wouldn't find that funny.
I thought he would come.
Call home!
It has been a long time since they last saw each other.
I haven't yet heard that story.
Who else is on that list?
She hates him.
They agree.
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Everyone for himself.
Come immediately.
Can I talk to you privately?
I am full.
Do it again!
We heard.
He speaks several languages.
My fate is in your hands.
Tom grimaced.
Let me speak to Tom.
Do you play soccer every day?
There is a lot to do every day.
What did you say?
Are you artistic?
He brought her home.
We're on the balcony.
Tom was wearing a nice suit.
We all love him.
Have you lost your reason?
Look at my new car.
Did something happen?
I give her my phone number.
I gave Tom a job.
I believe I can trust you.
Somebody caught me by the arm.
Go where nobody knows you.
Try to keep Tom from doing that.
Tom doesn't talk.
Tom will be thirty in October.
Tom looks young.
Naomi is very glad about having won first prize.
May God heal him from cancer!
Mary is a nice girl, except that she talks too much.
Are you bald?
Calm down.
When you have time, read this.
Be brave.
They have a problem.
Somebody was in the house.
Exercise is good for you.
You look sick.
Tom bought it for Mary.
Somebody had to do that.
Fantastic!
This dictionary isn't useful at all.
There is an empty room in the house.
Tom has known Mary since he was a kid.
They didn't say that.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
Somebody has ransacked my room.
You must come with me.
Tom needs help.
Do you think you can wait?
I understand your reasons.
I want you to work with Tom.
I don't remember where I met Tom for the first time.
Did you forget something?
Let me out!
Remember this!
I just emailed you.
You must be very busy now.
Someone made a mistake.
Who'll eat with us?
Smell this.
It's Darwin who wrote the origin of species.
I didn't know you had a brother.
Write Spanish.
Go get changed.
Do you remember what Tom said?
They are very alike to me.
Tom is bilingual.
Close the window.
We should teach children how to protect themselves.
Have you drank tea?
Tom was a university student in 2013.
You are an idiot!
There was no money left in my wallet.
They lied.
She doesn't smile for me anymore.
Somebody might stop me.
I read a book last night.
How lucky to meet you here.
It's already time to go home.
Fasten your seatbelts.
I want to buy this jacket.
Would you like me to read it to you?
Keep warm.
What do carpenters eat?
Does Tom help you in the kitchen?
Eat and drink.
You are thirsty.
You think I need to do that, don't you?
A language is not something you learn all at once.
I know you're writing a book.
He kissed my neck.
Nobody got killed.
I didn't say that.
Sami was expecting Layla to do something.
I know Tom went to Australia.
The milk tastes sour.
Sami's mouth was open.
Do you like football?
Many countries have laws prohibiting smoking.
Once more, please.
We need to find somebody who can help us.
If you have any problem, just call.
She loves you very much.
I need to eat now.
You said you were going to fix it.
Use the dustbin.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
Tom is going to be ready in October.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Are you scared?
You sound surprised.
Tom found something.
What will you be having?
Tom is lying on the table.
I want you to work with Tom.
Too much talk, no work.
Snow is white.
We were children at that time.
Did anyone call you?
I'm so happy for you.
Stand still!
Tom lives in Australia with his grandparents.
Tom quit.
It's dangerous!
Watch this.
I still have the hat I used to wear when I was thirteen.
The sky fell on our heads.
I knew Tom wouldn't suspect anything.
I think Tom is ugly.
I don't think you really have to do that.
When did you make this?
I'm going to show you how it's done.
Pace yourself.
No idea.
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
Please fix it.
I've got a good idea.
Tom gradually moved closer to Mary.
Stay cool.
What does he say?
They have failed.
I'll go swimming with you.
Tom looks sick.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Tom lied.
I will put this business through in a week.
We've all missed you.
The committee comprises ten members.
I screamed.
Are you OK?
Leave tomorrow.
Understand?
Tom knows what you're thinking.
Tinhinane lives in Ath Yenni, which is famous for its jewelry and its writer Mouloud Mammeri.
I did that one time.
Tom helped the old man across the road.
I'm Paola.
Tom said almost the same thing.
Where are your dogs?
Tom bowed.
I am happy.
Can you please help me?
Write me sometime, OK?
They haven't found Tom.
I thought you couldn't read.
Take care.
I'm not special.
Are you excited?
Do you speak Latin?
I apologize.
Tom is unmarried.
Truth prevails.
They all thought that Tom was crazy.
French is very difficult to learn.
I made you coffee.
Ann is a little girl.
I still remember doing that.
It's a town in the middle of nowhere.
You are drinking fresh water.
Every success in your new job.
How do you know she's sick?
Are you sure that Tom is here?
Clearly you are mistaken.
Someone made a mistake.
I use a computer every day.
In a moment, he will be dead.
Is this French?
Ignore him.
Please don't cry.
Call me when you land.
Tom listened patiently as the old man rambled on.
Be patient!

I've been assigned to work with you.
Do you know who did that?
She is a singer.
I won't let you pay.
Stop crying.
Don't talk!
I am your father.
I want you to try this.
How are you doing?
I need you here.
Say 'ahhh'.
Whatever!
Watch.
We got married on October 20, 2013.
When do you come and see me?
Tom and I are newlyweds.
He focused his eyes on the roof.
Oh boy...
We want to help Tom do that.
Why didn't you help us?
I thought somebody died.
Ask me anything!
This medicine will make you sleepy.
Sami has a lot of money.
Chuck Norris can press F13.
Sami came home for lunch break.
Let me hear from you.
I should like to go with you.
Someone is watching Tom.
Be prepared!
Stop complaining.
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
Tom's delirious.
I can't swim as fast as you.
Catherine was born in 1985.
Tom was depressed.
Have you been happy in Portugal?
Who wrote these stories?
Someone is lying.
Is there somebody you want to call?
Sami was trying to keep a positive vibe.
Tom became afraid of Mary.
You know a few things about your family?
Tom likes traveling.
Tom enjoys being in Australia.
Are you crazy?
I'm living in the city.
Champagne, please.
Why?
The boss asks why his employees are reluctant to work.
You make me feel dizzy!
Watch her.
I love parties.
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Stop daydreaming.
Did you call?
Tom seems to be very happy.
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat.
Ahmed Oumeri and Arezki L'Bashir are the Robin Hood of Kabylia that have existed.
Yes, Sir!
Take time to eat your meals.
I'll keep my word, whatever may happen.
Try to keep him occupied.
He is a spoiled child.
He's smart.
I can go to your house tomorrow.
What'll happen to Tom?
Aren't you going to join me?
When were you in Australia?
Poison can kill you.
Sami and Layla were looking at each other.
I don't feel like eating anything now.
Somebody saw you.
I don't know anything about potatoes.
Did you call?
Shut up!
She wants him.
Hang on!
Read!
Please do that.
Tom only slept for a few hours.
Why did you fire Tom?
I met them once before.
"What?" "Nothing."
Go get changed.
Smile!
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Of course I'll wait.
I almost drowned.
I like snow.
Does that make you happy?
It was by chance that I found this book.
Everybody paid.
Can you see in the darkness of the night?
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
It is nice to see you again.
I told Tom why I'd left early.
She keeps secrets.
I want to know who called.
Are you expecting someone?
Never mind!
Please find him.
Women share everything.
Answer me.
Someone is watching you.
Are you working tonight?
We will finish it.
I love you blindly.
Go home quickly.
Have you ever been in New York?
Could you sign this?
The Kabyle people love all peoples of the world.
Tom denies everything.
Is there somebody you want to call?
With whom did you go?
There's a phone call for you from Tom.
Tom's dog bit Mary.
I like the way Mary looks.
Have you been to Boston before?
Tom sent you something.
Somebody set the fire.
Tom hated Mary.
When I run, I get sweaty.
Got it!
Each guest must leave after the party.
Oh, hush!
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
Someone is waiting for Tom.
Sami was there.
Won't somebody help me?
Tatoeba is a good website for language learning.
Identify yourself.
Someone was here.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
You make me feel dizzy!
Is this love?
Tom and I talked about various things.
I wonder what the fuss is all about.
Can't anything be done?
Tom will protect Mary.
Are you from Kyoto?
Stop yelling.
Tom married an older girl.
Turn around.
Tom is unmarried.
This gift is for you.
Someone is watching you.
Take a bath and then go to bed.
I eat a book.
He's dead?
I haven't yet met Tom's parents.
Did you drive when you were in Australia?
Tom cooked dinner.
A little bit of luck sometimes leads to an unexpected success.
Forget it!
Speak louder, please.
What is your greatest fear?
What're you thinking?
I slept, and you?
Dan bought a new computer.
Listen up.
You are a snake!
Tom approves.
Show me your papers!
Close your eyes.
Forgive him.
You're a great writer.
You're all insane.
Somebody might stop us.
I'd like to see your sister.
Tom loves building things.
It's midnight.
Tom was found dead on October 20th.
Somebody called the police.
I want you to go with Tom.
Come here quickly.
Tom started crying.
I was happy to sell it.
I know you're writing a book.
You'd better put on a raincoat.
I am blind in the right eye.
I will be back soon.
What are you going to do?
I caught three fish this morning.
He dozed off.
Yell.
Tom is a good singer.
Thus said Zarathustra.
Clean up your room.
Are you interested in art?
Tom liked Australia.
They lied.
Be courteous.
I've been here since October 20th.
You should think about it first.
One question.
She refused to go with me.
Did you eat your spinach?
Stop!
I'm joyful.
You must have dropped your phone in your haste to catch the bus.
Cooking is interesting.
Save me.
Sami was reading a message from himself to Layla.
We were worried about you.
Tom passed away on October 20th, 2013.
Hopefully!
Stop dreaming.
I'm with somebody.
Leave tomorrow.
I love you bunches.
You can talk, can't you?
Speak softly.
Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
Construction should start in October.
This dictionary isn't useful at all.
I hope no one saw you doing that.
Do you see anyone here?
What is the purpose of education?
Nobody understands me.
We haven't abandoned you.
I'm not your slave!
I'm reading his books.
He will come to you tomorrow.
I felt cheated.
Choose carefully.
I wanted to be a farmer.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
We love studying music.
My foot is small beside yours.
If you have questions, ask away.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
Are you ill?
Forget it.
What's your friend's name?
Is someone there?
We're going to do it again.
Are you deaf?
I came yesterday.
I can kill you.
Are you that stupid?
You can't leave me like this.
Tom's trial started in October.
What time did you call Tom?
She died.
Tom says he's never heard Mary sing.
We love picnics.
I've got a good idea.
I neither drink nor smoke.
She has been busy since yesterday.
I know that you miss Tom.
Are you excited?
How much is that worth?
Everything he did was a success!
Tom is sneezing.
I'd like to try.
Hi, everybody.
Tom said he could help us do that.
Sami picked Layla up right after the game.
Tom shouldn't have hugged Mary.
I hate fighting.
Tom wondered why Mary never did that again.
Nobody wants to go to Boston with me.
Djafar doesn't know how to write correctly.
Nietzsche said: The belief in truth begins with the doubt of all truths in which one has previously believed.
I interviewed Tom Jackson on October 20th in Boston.
What did you put into the box?
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
It looks like you are from India.
You're a problem.
Say cheese.
Wait for me to come with you.
Tom nodded.
Are you stuck?
We're late for the dance.
May I have the menu, please?
Okay.
Can you also speak Portuguese?
My birthday is in October.
Tom felt happy.
Now that I am a teacher, I think otherwise.
Choose.
Who gave you those flowers?
Tom gets to do whatever he wants to do.
Did they feel bad for you?
Did you listen to her new song?
You are right.
Bring us two egg sandwiches, two cups of coffee and two pieces of apple pie, please.
This hotel has valet parking.
Are you new?
Did you swim yesterday?
Is someone meeting us?
Thank you for your call.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
Are you hiding?
I find it easy to do that.
Are you dead?
If you ask me, it was just a waste of time.
That girl wearing a red dress is Mary.
Stop singing.
Make a decision.
Tom contacted Mary.
You had better have your hair cut.
Mary whistled.
Ken has not washed the car yet.
I'm going to eat now.
I know that you miss Tom.
Come tomorrow.
Tom likes listening to Mary sing.
Tom says he isn't busy tomorrow.
Tom sent you something.
There's nothing I can do about Tom.
Are you home?
Be reasonable.
Are you making him a sandwich?
I'll write you a note.
Nobody knew.
Tom is good at talking to people.
The hall contains 5,000 people.
Someone's singing.
Fuckin' asshole!
Tom had no idea Mary liked him.
I often travel.
Sit down.
You're prejudiced.
You don't have brown eyes.
I'm Russian.
Tom's dead.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Sami was about six.
Did you want something?
There's somebody there.
You need somebody like me.
Ignore it.
She knows how to live.
Do you mind if I eat here with you?
Let dinner wait.
Where were you last spring?
What time did you come home?
Are you lost?
Tom gasped.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to look after him.
Tom waited his turn.
I love the way you kiss me.
Wait a moment.
Come into my room.
Enjoy your work!
Did you want something?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Did you know Mary before she joined the team?
Are you calling from Australia?
Do you think we'll win?
Tom said tomorrow is Monday.
Tom is good at this game, isn't he?
I didn't tell Tom that you were here.
Sit there.
That's Mary's husband.
Tom walked toward Mary.
I'm going home.
I can do nothing about that.
Stop meddling.
I have a slow Internet connection.
Eat snow.
Tell me what I should've done.
Girls are crazy.
Read these instructions.
I knew Tom would be the winner.
They sweated.
Tom is lucky he didn't get killed.
I'm not here to hurt you.
I want you to go with Tom.
Are you human?
His understanding of logic is abysmal.
Tom can read French.
Come here.
Send Tom to me.
Wait a moment.
I am beside myself.
You're perfect at everything.
Who will take his place?
Make it short.
I don't want to eat here tonight.
He's a liar.
He is a singer.
I've already told you what we had for lunch.
Sami started to really freak out.
I was caught in the rain.
Somebody killed Tom.
Somebody called the police.
Sami is one of Farid's friends.
There is not a language which doesn't have some loanwords.
Control yourselves.
Perfect. Thank you.
Who stayed?
They built it.
Nothing is happening.
Tom angrily stared at Mary.
We talked about Australia.
Listen carefully.
He considers himself ill.
I told you it would work.
Come!
I'm sorry that you lost.
Tom and Mary are constantly fighting.
Let me be.
Why do people dye their hair?
You must bear it in mind.
She obeys him.
You should apologize.
I will come with you.
Drive safely.
Everything changes.
Tom is intellectual.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Boston.
Do you come back from Tibet?
Somebody will see us.
Welcome back.
I don't fear death.
Show us around.
I studied.
We like our Kabyle language.
Tom broke up with me.
If you want to leave, then leave now!
The rabbit was a coward and they made it worse for him with drums.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
She loves you very much.
They like literature.
Your problem is that you think you have to do everything your parents tell you to do.
Did someone contact you?
Sami forgot this advice.
Are you crazy?
Choose one person.
Cars are expensive.
You need a good woman.
Tom is worried about the economy.
They are dead.
Tom passed away on October 20th.
I'll be thirteen in October.
Life is fun.
Have you already read this?
Tom looked ready.
Somebody was murdered.
Talk to somebody.
Goodbye, Ian.
Are you leaving?
We're planning a trip to Boston.
Let him do it.
Tom wasn't afraid to talk about his own shortcomings.
Whose bag is this?
Don't forget your phone.
The bride looked very beautiful.
She lied.
Don't eat to excess.
Open the window.
Tom babysat Mary.
That's the way Tom always does it.
Tom and Mary entered the Church of Satan.
I learned that from you!
Tom never lies.
I feel something.
I was in Boston when that happened.
He had the golden touch!
Guess again.
Her suitcase is too heavy.
He is French.
The Lebanese student and her friends wrote books.
I was reading a book.
I did it just for you!
How many eggs do you eat a week?
Tom took the last available spot.
I don't know where he is.
He is old.
I thought we were friends.
I don't let my children eat candy.
I disagree.
Are you tired?
Call us.
Come immediately.
I've done many things I shouldn't have.
Tom looks about ready to explode.
I believe you.
Jaffer betrays his people.
When he came out of work, he took his afternoon snack.
Did you call?
Are you there?
I don't remember!
Would you come our house?
I don't think Tom will ever forgive me for doing that.
Is there something that you want?
I play Chopin.
Can we swim?
Stay calm.
You need to be in Boston next Monday.
I didn't swim yesterday.
I can't hear a word.
Do you know Tom's real name?
They have to take a rest.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
They smiled.
He is very mean to me.
Do whatever you want to do.
Keep trying.
He recently sent me a touching poem he wrote after his mother's death.
Do you see a queen?
Did you find your letters?
Nobody knew.
A Mr West called in your absence.
Tom approved.
Go to school.
See you later.
I don't have what he's looking for.
Why doesn't anybody help Tom?
Don't let anyone come near the fire.
Someone is watching.
Awesome!
Tom failed.
He was sacrificed.
Sami doesn't play this game.
Tom says he thinks Mary isn't going to win.
Tom is extremely polite.
How old is your grandfather?
Return to your place.
Be brave.
Tom is a talented actor, isn't he?
I didn't know you had a brother.
Hold on! I am coming right now!
Eat everything.
Tom is beginning to irritate me.
I want to spend time with Tom.
Tom couldn't save Mary.
Why are you alone?
Life lies in front of you.
It takes years to master a foreign language.
Tom is an atheist.
Somebody intervened.
Sami saw it again.
I wanted somebody to talk to.
Someone is watching Tom.
How lovely!
Do you understand what he's saying?
Somebody's waiting for you.
Are you angry?
Have you ever been in Brazil?
This is my opinion, not yours.
Please bring a glass of beer.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
I'm an American citizen.
You are rich.
Tom always greets his neighbors.
I did nothing.
Are you ready to order?
This is my email address.
He went to a bar to drinks some beers.
I'm buying.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Did you hear what they were saying?
Tom is present, isn't he?
We think about that a lot.
Stop daydreaming.
The cat that you found is mine.
Tom built a model airplane.
Tom admitted he despises Mary.
Go and take a cold shower.
I understood.
Sami did a very stupid thing.
Stop laughing.
Catch Tom.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Tom is exactly the same age as Mary.
I've got to speak to Tom.
You are children.
Tom was distracted by Mary.
We make great money.
Someone is watching you.
You walk quickly!
Tom is having the same problem I am.
I heard that Tom wants a divorce.
I need a rental car.
We've seen the two teachers.
Whose is it?
Some of the apples in the box were rotten.
Would you like something to read?
You are a boy, not a girl.
Do you know how to program?
Save Tom.
Who found you?
Did somebody say something?
Tom hates dogs.
Tom saw Mary at the Halloween party.
Tom likes French.
They yelled.
Quiet down.
The watch hand has turned, and time has left them!
I found them there.
She wants independence for her soul and her thoughts.
Tom told me he likes Mary a lot.
Unbelievable!
Tom crashed.
Does Tom drink?
I love my brothers and sisters.
Are the fingers yours?
Call us.
I found this book very difficult.
I can't live that kind of life.
He still has not written the letter.
You're all crazy.
Sami was rude to customers.
Nobody went there.
Carry this.
Some of what you said sounded stupid.
Tom told everybody he was very hungry.
Straighten up.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
Would you do that for us?
I don't have kids.
I still don't agree with Tom.
Your mother eats shit.
She lost everything she had.
Where's your uncle?
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
You can call me when you want.
What do you feed your dog?
It was night.
You can't tell Tom what to do.
Good for you.
Is that French?
Sami was a complete nerd when he was younger.
Tom was ignoring Mary.
Are you angry?
I'm glad to see you, too.
Did they check them?
I'll give you something to eat.
It happened.
Don't you think you speak French better than me?
Somebody tried to kill you.
You're a problem.
Mummy cried.
Tom lost.
Meet me downstairs.
Everyone thinks so.
Look ahead.
Tom died in October of 2013.
You can study here.
Are you sure that you have enough money?
You need a good woman.
Is that a picture of me?
Are you alive?
I forgot to ask Tom to do that.
Drive slowly.
You refused to pay.
You escaped.
Nobody cares who you are.
Get up!
You lie.
You don't have to eat that if you don't want to.
We hope it doesn't happen again.
Stand up, please.
I wish it were always like this.
Slowly, please.
Nice car!
Wait for him.
Amayas lives in Tikejda which is a tourist place.
I might be homeless by next October.
I love games.
Tom married a rich widow.
What a handsome young man!
Tom became nervous.
Help yourself.
Bring her home.
It's so heavy that I can't lift it.
Wood burns easily.
They didn't say anything.
Why doesn't Tom want to go?
Somebody has broken this dish.
Do you eat eggs?
We're extremely busy right now.
She won!
Tom and Mary were tired, but happy.
A Mr Sato called in your absence.
I didn't lie. You did.
Somebody did that already.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
This car is my father's.
Is it white?
It's best to tell the truth.
Quit gambling.
I like sleeping.
Tom thought I was Mary.
Hey, you.
I lost my keys.
Where are you staying?
Tom should've bought flowers for Mary.
I bought it.
My garden is small.
You are going to have a little sister.
Didn't you know that Tom was a friend of Mary's?
Change your clothes.
Be brave!
He loves reading.
Can I come?
Don't force yourself to eat if you don't want to.
OK. I agree.
I know Tom likes a challenge.
Do you talk about us?
What kind of fish do you like to eat?
You're truthful.
Tom attacked Mary.
Did someone say something?
October was worse.
Tom left for Australia.
Why don't they say something?
Let me be.
Do you still swim?
Tom said I have to wait until Monday.
Stop shouting.
Sami and Layla used to butt heads all the time.
If you want to leave, then leave now!
Did you read this?
I'll go see.
Tom needs somebody to help him.
Tom didn't kiss Mary.
Don't be late for school.
It's raining cats and dogs!
What does this look like to you?
Tom exaggerates.
Tom contributed.
Who wrote these stories?
Let me be.
How many times a month do you eat out?
Is it true that you can't swim?
Tom told me he'd sing.
I hope no one sees you like this.
We no longer love when we are in love.
Are you expecting someone?
Please give me a ring this evening.
Is that the truth?
If I were you, I would go home and take a good rest.
You can't speak French, can you?
Eating is an art.
Let me be.
Please respond.
Are you human?
Somebody's watching us.
I get a haircut every month.
I know the difference.
Tom is going to be thirty in October.
Could you take me to this seat?
Tom cared.
You know I can't.
They're cool.
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
My father neither smokes nor drinks.
Tom told her that he had written that poem two years before.
Talk to somebody.
Try to keep her occupied.
Tom had to resign from his job.
I think that she will come.
Look behind you.
I thank you for your gift.
I went to Boston, too.
I'd like to try on this dress.
No one ate the cake.
Tom has told me so much about you.
Tom says he isn't feeling any better.
Everyone smiled.
Wash up.
Please listen.
If Mary had been here, she'd have helped us.
What are you waiting for?
Tom said I needed to study French.
Is there something troubling you?
Tom gave the baby a bath.
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
Why are you reading that?
Go faster.
Without a doubt!
Sami knew this was a lie.
Are you expecting someone?
We slept in the same bed.
Somebody's watching us.
What're you going to do this weekend?
Is this where you live?
I won't make you leave.
What papers do you take?
Somebody might've overheard you.
So tasty!
Follow that car.
Sami has to hurry up.
Tom is a bad guy.
They're still following us.
I know it takes courage to do that.
Don't stop here.
No, thank you. I don't drink coffee.
You're going to laugh.
Spring is here.
Pass the ketchup.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
They're dead.
Somebody has left his hat.
Call the cops.
What are you going to do?
I think you'd better tell him.
Where are you?
He doesn't go outside at night.
Computers are very useful.
When did he come here?
Be straight!
Will you permit us to leave now?
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
I met her once before.
Tom is hiding something.
Tom called.
Here's some money. Go buy yourself something to eat.
Yes, certainly.
Carry this.
Slowly, please.
Are they busy?
He backed his car into the garage.
Don't give Tom what he's asking for.
They're using you.
Why doesn't that bother you?
Why would you ever think so?
You are talking.
I'm fairly busy.
I was the director for three years.
You can use this dictionary.
I feel happy.
Why do you want all this stuff?
Are you a Buddhist?
How I have missed you!
Paper burns easily.
It rained on and off all day.
I knew we'd find you.
Somebody's waiting for you.
In the northern countries, winter is hard.
Please listen.
I'm turning thirty in October.
It's going to get cold tonight.
You should've done that in October.
Tom is still crying.
Nobody went there.
Everyone screamed.
Stay in the car.
Has someone died?
Tom isn't likely to want to do that with us.
No, he can't.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
I wanted to kill you.
Push.
You saw yourself in the mirror.
Try using a different browser.
I wish Tom would leave me alone.
I know some of the boys.
Ask around.
Forget me.
Tell me what I should've done.
Everyone plays his game!
I've already called her.
Well done!
Tom is mischievous.
He is here.
Pot calling the kettle black.
There's somebody in the tunnel.
I overslept.
You should eat something.
Someone is watching Tom.
I understand your reasons.
Sometimes a nod is enough to show someone that you're listening attentively.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
Tom emigrated to Australia.
Someone stole my wallet.
You make me feel dizzy!
Tom said that Mary wasn't very surprised.
Mary giggled.
Where's your grandmother?
Could be.
Fuck the system.
Some children are swimming in the river.
Sami unholstered his pistol.
Were you really in Boston?
Water is comprised of oxygen and hydrogen.
I don't swim every day.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
What time did you see Tom doing that?
I love you bunches.
This wall crushed my toe.
Talk to somebody.
He is a singer.
What did you go there for?
Keep searching.
This is my opinion, not yours.
Take that!
My daughter is getting married in June.
Have a drink with me.
I need those letters.
Sami and Layla made a good couple.
They're not suspicious.
Please don't leave me.
Do tell!
Talk!
Did someone contact you?
Somebody will do that.
Who spoke?
Be tolerant.
You look Japanese.
You see what I mean?
I eat here.
Tom is going to be here next week.
Are you related?
Away with you!
Are you from Australia?
In the end, everything is fine. Otherwise it's not the end!
Forget Tom.
Are you sure that you know what to do?
Welcome, everybody.
It looks like I got here too early.
The elephant is being bored: bring to him a fellow back.
What time did you come home?
Layla is a pretty girl.
They know the truth.
It isn't as complicated as it sounds.
Tom and I talked to each other by phone.
I knew Tom wasn't dead.
Why didn't you call somebody?
The night has just begun.
Don't be late for school.
The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
Do you know that Zinedine Zidane is Kabyle?
You should've done that with us.
She's dead.
You're all right.
You were approaching.
Paul was born in Rome.
Do you know those children?
Is someone there?
She can speak.
This is Tom calling.
Get ready.
Leave me.
Breathe!
Don't rush things.
Finally, you have nothing in the noggin!
We speak.
I can teach you how to read.
Get dressed.
I want to work at a hospital.
Be reasonable.
Stop laughing.
Tom bought Mary a dictionary.
She can't love you.
Get dressed quickly.
Tom doesn't speak French as fluently as you do.
I believe you.
I hope no one saw you.
Something made Tom angry.
Stop them!
Give it to me.
I don't know why Tom would've done that.
Did you dye your hair?
We need to find somebody who can help us.
What do you want from Tom?
Can you give me your telephone number, please?
Winter is approaching.
How long have you been living in this house?
Where are your sisters?
Terrific!
He smiled.
Tom will be missed.
Tom isn't a good writer.
How many days a year do you swim?
She couldn't convince him to accept the bribe.
This house isn't very big.
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Nobody will convince me otherwise.
Have you got a dog?
Do you play any sports?
Years passed.
Please help yourself to the salad.
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
Tom was wide awake.
I never tried doing that again.
Good.
He is eating.
Do they love each other?
Did Tom believe it?
You are drunk!
Think of your future.
There's somebody out there.
Do it again!
That's not what I'm saying.
Stop mocking me.
Tom said he considered doing that.
Where were you this morning?
We'll wait for you there.
I'm glad you were there.
Listen here!
Is this art?
There is nothing like ice cream in the summer.
I hear you clear.
Please don't touch this.
Tom was homeschooled.
I can't wait to see Tom's Halloween costume.
I opened the door for Tom.
I'm not tall.
I was at your wedding.
Let's try and find a cure.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
My uncle calls on me every three days.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Do you like dogs?
Are you there?
You're a problem.
OK, I won't do it again.
Why don't you go outside and play?
Fix this.
He wants to ask Mary for something.
Girls are crazy.
How to love a girl from whom we can not see anything?
Somebody stole my car.
Tom bought drinks for everybody in the bar.
What happened to your ankle?
Mary shrieked.
Where's your grandson?
Wait outside.
Go to school.
Tom died in October three years ago.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I prefer oranges to apples.
Tell me.
I think Mary has never done that by herself.
Thomas swam.
I saw Tom hit Mary.
Mary likes you.
Kill me.
Tom's room isn't very big.
What's been bothering you?
Chicken, please.
I start.
I didn't mean to step on your foot.
Come on.
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics.
Tom regrets having agreed to do that.
I'll call again later.
Forgive her.
Sami rented the house for Layla.
You look European.
Tell Tom what you need.
Just let things happen as they will.
Are your parents teachers?
My hands were numb.
Read it again, please.
Tom attempted to swim across the river.
Stop them!
I really have to eat something.
Do you know how to program?
Please stop eating.
He backed his car into the garage.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Everybody was really happy.
May I take a rest?
Do you remember what Tom said?
I told Tom why I wasn't there.
I don't want you to understand.
Get lost!
I'm not interested in your religion.
We did it by ourselves.
I'm a foreigner.
You're all right.
Keep fighting.
I don't see the small car.
I'm going to go out and get us something to eat.
They have company.
Is Tom ill?
Are you handicapped?
Somebody must've left it there.
I'm afraid it'll rain tonight.
Your request is denied.
Tom is quiet.
Tom reinstalled the software that had accidentally been deleted.
How I have missed you!
Please repeat.
What were you doing when I called this morning?
Are you a foreigner?
Football is like a religion in this country.
In Africa, there is no difference between a white and a black.
Get a haircut.
Tom only wants one cup of tea.
When did you come back from Germany?
Look at my new car.
What swagger!
Obey your teachers.
That hurts.
She rejected his offer of help.
Can I do anything to help them?
Let's go again.
Are you lost?
Tom wouldn't like it in Australia.
Aksil wants to travel to the desert.
Did you watch this movie?
I can't think otherwise.
This is my opinion, not yours.
Tom is wrong.
Berber is a family of languages spoken in North Africa.
On October 20, 2013, Tom married Mary in Boston.
Tom does love Mary.
Somebody did that already.
Everyone giggled.
Tom counts on Mary.
Show me your true face.
Tom saw Mary dancing with John.
Someone is watching.
Keep writing.
Where is my pen?
You must come home.
Keep out!
I'd like to go for a swim.
I bought it.
Get lost!
Why did you come to me?
I don't give a shit.
I moved here last October.
Are you drinking?
Sleep!
We're going to eat at a Chinese restaurant tonight.
Tom wants Mary.
Have you got through with your work?
Tom killed himself in October.
If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes.
Please come here.
How many do you have?
Tom disliked Mary.
Tom showed Mary something.
We were praying.
I wonder what it would be like to be famous.
I am afraid of cats.
Tom hates going to school.
Everything came out okay in the end.
Do you have many friends who don't eat meat?
Tom will assist Mary.
I wonder what I will do once I get home.
Tell Tom I can't marry him.
Did Tom say he'd stay in Australia?
Can you come?
Everybody blames you.
He accelerated.
I've done half the work, and now I can take a break.
I saw somebody.
Somebody's going to pay.
You're the teacher.
Your face is getting red.
We did that on October 20th.
I have another solution.
Tom misses Mary.
I see how you are studying.
There's not much to say.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
Are you Russian?
Do you like my friend?
Pass me the salt.
He built a house.
Who swam?
He's not studying music.
You are mad.
Mary is a smart lady.
We met on October 20th last year.
What's become of Tom?
Let me be.
Mom, when's supper?
I cannot read French.
Can somebody help?
Tom isn't likely to want to do that with us.
Really?
Have another.
Will your father eat dinner with you tonight?
Stop bothering me!
I'm afraid it'll rain tonight.
This bicycle is mine.
Somebody came to our house.
Give examples.
Tom never talked about you.
I spoke French.
Nobody deserves to die like that.
I will trust you with one secret.
Tom can cook.
Have you had an answer?
Stand up, please.
She sang pretty well.
They waited.
Tom's in there.
Somebody poisoned her.
Save me!
Have you got through with your work?
He put a case on his back.
Please look at this.
I was called on in French class.
God created man in his own image, God is a warrior.
Not tonight.
Thank you.
Let's try something.
Read it again.
Tom told me that he loves me.
Give it back!
I need you here tomorrow.
Tom agreed to meet Mary.
I don't want to wait that long.
Lions are magnificent creatures.
Tom did a good job here.
Do you want to see our English lesson?
Did somebody call the police?
Somebody's watching us.
The dog ate it.
Are you hiring?
Tom became popular.
Why not?
I'm going to stop her from ever doing that again.
I'd rather be by myself.
Show it to Tom.
What are your hobbies?
Why didn't you call me earlier?
Are you lying to me?
Do it now.
I like rock music.
Smile!
I have no patience.
Hate the Algerian authority.
Stay with me for a moment.
Tom said he likes teaching French.
Horses are animals.
He is a writer.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
I don't need your job.
Jaffer betrays his people.
Be careful, there's a car!
Three days later, Tom was dead.
You shouldn't go to work.
How can I know if a girl likes me?
Get down.
Tom dropped the spoon into his pocket.
Sami never had this problem.
Tom certainly is an eloquent speaker.
I hope you understand.
Tom told me I was pretty.
Did you see something?
To whom did you give the book?
Are you sick?
Mary made her children's Halloween costumes.
Mary is rich, isn't she?
Tom isn't shy, but Mary is.
Is it a recent picture?
Over here!
The severely injured man was dead on arrival at the hospital.
Are you Ukrainian?
You can go home now.
How could this happen to us?
I've come to talk with you again.
I can teach you how to read.
Have you asked if they want one?
Are you asleep?
Someone is watching.
After eating, the first thing I do is brush my teeth.
Tom knows that he isn't going to win.
Get inside.
Somebody has to do it.
You have a very nice smile.
Tom sent you something.
You understand, don't you?
Are you crazy?
Every morning I ask myself why.
You have a green book.
The world is changing every minute.
We failed.
I don't speak French or German.
Tom wasn't helping Mary.
I don't think you really have to do that.
There are three buttons.
Somebody is watching us.
Did anybody call on you yesterday?
Do you have anything hot to drink?
I know that you miss Tom.
You need to relax.
Good things come to those who wait.
Tom wants to see Mary.
Do you like Spain?
I don't have any money in my pockets.
Are you hiring?
What is over there?
Start running.
You're wet through.
They paid separately.
Somebody wants to kill me.
I forgot to feed my dog.
I'm Melanie.
Would you pass the salt, please?
They told me few days ago.
The people thirst for freedom.
I was playing.
Romulus reigned for thirty-seven years.
Sami's car is not over here.
Stop them.
I paused.
Make me a sandwich.
Are you sincere?
I don't think Tom is back.
She likes dogs a lot.
How I have missed you!
How I have missed you!
Ok.
Tom divorced Mary.
We must respect the rights of the individual.
Hands off.
Why are you cursing?
Wash your face.
Who told you Tom would be here?
Is there somebody you want to call?
I'd like another cup of coffee.
Stay here.
They live there.
Well, what?
Do you think Tom and Mary are ready for this?
I don't want to wait that long.
It was really sad.
Tom is getting ready for a party.
Keep quiet!
What do we call you?
They live in the suburbs.
I wasn't a good student in high school.
Tom has moved to Australia.
Send this letter by air.
Stop arguing.
She came!
I was in Boston last year on October 20th.
Have you got a little sister?
How long do you think it would take you to paint my house?
I read a book.
Do you see your table?
The chicken is cooked.
He knows how to live.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Who is your brother?
Read this now.
He is not a boy.
Somebody poisoned them.
Tom said Mary was unlikely to win.
Be brave!
It is time to go to school.
What kind of food do you eat?
What if somebody saw this?
Look alive.
What's your philosophy?
Tom threw me the apple.
When did you find this?
Who told you that Tom didn't win?
Control yourself.
Ignore that.
I am for your opinion.
When is your birthday?
Anzar's fiancee is beautiful.
The problem is solved.
Tom seemed to be ignoring Mary.
She is five years old.
Why are they so afraid?
I suspect that Tom and Mary are wrong about that.
Get your carcass out of here!
I'll try to live up to your expectations.
Something's different.
Please stop it.
Stop smoking.
Somebody has broken this dish.
They will not succeed.
I think you will find it convenient to put a short-cut on the desktop.
I have something to give you.
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
I thought somebody died.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
May I go home now?
Learning languages is interesting.
I haven't done that since October.
The night has just begun.
Can you help me translate that into French?
Am I wrong?
You shouldn't go to work.
She reads.
Tom and I aren't divorced.
I read the book.
Please wait.
You're part of the problem.
I'm not used to working outside.
Know thyself!
Stop dreaming.
Tom loves fishing.
How many books did you read?
I think Tom is romantic.
What did you go there for?
I told Tom where I wanted to go.
I don't like this program.
I like winter.
No one ate the cake.
That's a very useful piece of information.
We are teachers.
I decided to ask Mary out.
Tell him.
She is my sister.
It's Monday.
What are you going to do if it rains?
You can use my dictionary.
Follow us.
I have to study.
Who told you you could swim here?
That was fabulous.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
What did you go there for?
You could kill someone.
Cut the potatoes.
I thought somebody died.
Stop them.
Tom was the first one to finish the test.
When are you planning to leave?
What a lovely day!
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Stand aside.
Neither Tom nor Mary wants to do that.
She runs.
The baby is hungry.
Return to your place.
Are you prepared?
We're not used to it.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
They adopted the orphan.
We can't continue without Tom.
Did you give Tom a present for his birthday?
I'm now busy writing a book.
He exaggerates!
I shrugged.
I want someone to talk to.
You had to study English.
Nothing much.
Try to keep Tom happy.
Let me explain why.
Tom wasn't afraid to ask for help.
Somebody knows that.
You never say that you love me.
There's a dog following us.
Hot outside?
I love what you are.
I lost everything.
Think again.
What are you reading?
My positive self-talk creates my reality.
How did it go?
Tom said he learned something new.
My grandfather has no idea what the Berber language means.
I love jokes.
You helped us.
Do you have any light beer?
Who does Tom think he is?
Do you come back from Tibet?
This time it's different.
You're a very good student.
I paid.
The fisherman's story is fishy.
Tom went to Boston at the end of October.
I believed you.
How much fuel did you save?
Chicken and rice is Tom's favorite dish.
I don't remember where I met Tom for the first time.
Rise up and you'll have, stand up and you'll see, stay there and you'll have nothing!
Stop sniffling.
How did you enjoy your time in Boston?
You know that Tom can't win.
Where are you going today?
Everyone knows.
The girl resembles her mother.
There is nobody in this room.
I cringed.
Someone called Tom.
What is your father's name?
Tom looks relieved.
Do you want me to call her?
Her hair grew back.
Perhaps I am mistaken.
I left my wife.
Stay close.
Can you fix this?
Was the umbrella you found Tom's?
Sleep!
I am pleased at your success.
I'll try again.
Loosen it.
Enter!
Are you German?
Your big sis will show you.
You speak like your mother.
Why don't you go to Tom's house?
Why are you alone?
Are you retired?
And God said: Let there be light. And there was light.
Tom and Mary were looking at each other.
Where are your aunts?
Somebody wants to send a message.
I want you to stay in Australia at least until Christmas.
Have you lost your reason?
Find the cat.
Bees make honey.
Tom will find somebody.
Would you do that for us?
How handsome you are!
Who spoke French?
Dream on!
Tom was unshaven.
Tom said he liked it a lot.
Tom will get married soon.
Please ask someone else.
It'll take an hour to get there.
Are they coming here tomorrow?
She writes beautifully.
The boy is very honest.
Tom lacks motivation.
You can't leave me like this.
Tom thought Mary would like to go to Boston to see John.
Are you OK?
Somebody has been sleeping on this sofa.
There is little milk in the jar.
It's his, isn't it?
Tom wants to stop Mary.
Somebody killed Tom.
Don't say another word.
Tom said that I had to study French.
What would you like to do while you're here?
I'm supposed to go to Australia in October.
I lost hope.
I believed you.
My father is a doctor.
Thailand is not Taiwan.
Have you seen the new film?
Tom isn't much older than Mary is.
Tom is breathing.
Tom would have understood.
Have you ever heard someone speaking in Esperanto?
We do not need more than that.
You are not trying!
Call me if there's any change.
We didn't order this.
I came back early.
It is something my mother made.
The play was a lot of fun. I wish you could've been there.
She went for a walk yesterday.
Tell the truth.
I vomited.
Please put a lot of cream in my coffee.
What are you actually talking about?
Why would we want to punish you?
Write something.
Dance!
It cannot have rained during the night.
Ken has not washed the car yet.
Is that your husband?
Tom abandoned Mary.
Can you speak Indonesian?
If Mary had been here, she'd have helped us.
Somebody just called.
October 20th was a busy day.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
Whose go is it?
Could you take me to this seat?
They're mocking you.
Did you swim much?
Answer him.
I'm sure they're wrong.
Are you going to sell Tom your house?
Tom's bleeding.
Do you know which room the meeting will be held in?
I knew that today would be fun.
Did it rain all night?
When did they go?
I need you to tell me the truth.
No worries!
Tom argued with Mary.
Sami was touching my things.
I don't think Tom will like Boston.
Are you wealthy?
Let me go!
I heard someone scream.
We found Mary.
Divide and conquer.
That's amazing!
You are home.
Is that your book?
Say it clearly.
Where are you coming from?
Suit yourself.
Tom used to cry a lot.
Sami started at that man.
I wanted somebody to talk to.
We're flying to Boston tomorrow.
Have you got a bike?
Your moment has arrived!
Are you joking?
I will trust you with one secret.
The poetry and music of Zedek Mouloud don't leave listeners indifferent.
I saw him no more.
With whom are you talking?
Just talk with them.
When did they go?
You have to tell him.
I seldom sing.
Who benefits?
I don't like big dogs.
Make a wish.
You'll see.
Watch the road.
Tom had never kissed anyone before.
You lost.
Do you remember what Tom said?
How many times did you go swimming last summer?
You are the blood of my blood.
Come anytime.
Animals run.
We all hate you.
Just swim.
Can somebody answer that?
Tom said he didn't know the rules.
Call 911!
I tripped.
Tom phoned.
Whose guitar is this?
She left for Boston.
How lucky you are!
Somebody's in trouble.
I fainted.
What time do you leave for school?
What does this look like to you?
Tom turned green with envy.
Be tolerant.
Do you want eggs?
Tom looks worried.
Sami drove Layla to the mall to return those shoes.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
They understood.
Look here.
We cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.
I'm feeling low.
We learned French.
Enjoy.
Leave Tom alone.
Someone is watching.
You'd better not argue with Tom.
Drink some tea.
Perhaps he will come.
Clean yourself up, Tom.
Sami wanted to kiss Layla.
Thanks anyway.
I'll buy you something to eat.
I like mathematics.
Tom opened a bottle of beer.
Tom can't believe Mary.
Again!
I do not read books.
Please correct it.
What if she won't give it to you?
Please introduce me to a cute girl.
Tom looks scared.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
You can't go in with this.
Tom always helps Mary.
Do good to those who hate you.
Sami went right.
You need to stay away from them.
They swam.
I've been learning to drive.
Did Tom work for you?
I met them last night.
Tom asked me about Mary.
He dozed off.
What is your philosophy?
You must not eat so much candy.
Hi everyone.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Tom is dreaming.
Rest.
Mary will come with me if she finishes her work.
Tell him.
Somebody is watching us.
Do you want to help me?
Tom told me he saw somebody kissing Mary.
There are two cars in his garage.
I found the way to her heart.
They jumped.
Someone is calling you.
You can read this book.
It hurts!
Bring it in, Tom.
Tom ordered an extra large pizza.
Help me.
They never said anything about that.
A language is not something you learn all at once.
Tom died on the morning of October 20th.
Forty people attended.
Tom went bonkers.
Tom broke up with Mary.
How do you propose to help?
There's a phone call for you from Tom.
How would they find out?
No one's in there.
Are you prepared?
Skip it.
Stop screaming.
The picture is blurry.
Everything changes.
Can somebody help?
My fate is in your hands.
You walk quickly!
Don't eat that.
Did they check him?
I got somebody to help me do that.
Aim higher.
I have two sisters and one brother.
Let me hear from you.
You are old.
You betrayed your country.
My foot is small beside yours.
Have you already read this?
Tom was unkind to Mary.
But do you love it?
Get moving.
I need space.
Somebody's in trouble.
What did you eat yesterday?
No one is answering.
You may go home now.
Tom said that he liked it a lot.
Go inside.
Do you want to eat now?
Come here.
Tell me when you'll call me.
Somebody has stolen my suitcase.
Would you pass me the salt?
They helped us.
Take cover!
Someone stole my watch.
You are so smart!
Tom whistled.
Do you have the conscience to do such a thing?
Why didn't you come to Boston last summer?
I want you to get out of town.
Tom warned Mary.
Tom slammed the door angrily.
Tom seemed to be a nice fellow.
Sami wasn't just anybody for Layla.
Stop talking.
Can you speak Indonesian?
They applauded.
Do you have any animals?
There was nothing you could've done to help.
Keep oil away from the fire.
Let me know.
Tom is yelling.
Would you pass me the salt, please?
Try to keep him occupied.
Could we have a table by the window?
Tom wants to kill Mary.
Write it down.
When did they go?
I acted in accordance with my own conviction.
I've never been to Paris.
I'd love to do it again.
Tom can't forget Mary.
You have only to go with me.
Please reply.
What does her father do?
Please tell me your real name.
Come immediately.
Hello, what is your name?
I want to know more about your country.
Tom called Mary.
I don't want to leave Tom.
Problem solved!
"Don't you have friends?" "Of course."
Tom is now looking for another job.
God knows.
She stopped talking.
As if!
Tom and I understand each other.
I need someone to help me do this.
Tom complained.
Tom said doing that would be safe.
Tom began to cry.
She abandoned her child.
Somebody stole my lunch.
This is Tom's wife.
Let's just get this over with.
Tom kicked Mary.
I was up in the mountains.
They don't seem happy.
You are in Boston.
Somebody tried to kill you.
No one here can swim.
Ready for take-off.
Both Tom and Mary had the same idea.
Tom didn't talk about you.
You're lucky.
Aren't you cold out here?
Tom can't find Mary.
I hate him with every fiber of my being.
Nobody cares who you are.
Get dressed.
You saw yourself in the mirror.
You are German?
Something happened.
Stop crying.
Mice are drinking the water.
Tom was fired in October.
Someone stole my money.
Today's October twentieth.
Tom and I stayed at the same hotel.
Are you working tomorrow?
Do you want that warmed up?
Forgive him.
Tom wears the same costume every Halloween.
Everybody waited.
Our dog is black.
When are you going to get married?
They were eating.
They were killed just because they were not whites.
Somebody stole it from me.
I believe I can trust you.
Where did you find this key?
Understood.
Tell everybody.
Tom left the band in October.
Tom said that he knew what to do.
Somebody called.
You absolutely have to watch it.
Please go.
There's something missing.
You saw that movie, didn't you?
Tom lives in Rome
Can somebody help me?
Tom taught French.
I stayed home.
Don't leave me alone.
I just received your letter.
I hate working.
Someone's outside.
Somebody tried to kill me.
They loved you.
Good luck.
I found your cap.
Somebody knocked on the door.
Please bring me a clean knife.
Mary is glowing.
Someone is watching.
We slept.
Even children can read this book.
Just talk with them.
What?
Does anyone on your team speak French?
We forgot.
Please do as I say.
Feed me.
Get some rest.
The world is changing every minute.
Can I take your order now?
You must go to bed now.
Someone is watching Tom.
Tom waved.
He read a story to his children.
Tom isn't good at talking to people.
Beauty fades.
We're trying to help you.
Rest is important.
Tom didn't talk about you.
Can you take a picture of us?
He is at home today.
What Tom said makes no sense.
Tom is staying here with us for three weeks.
Mr. White's yard is large.
Quiet down.
Are you lying?
He has to take a rest.
Seize him!
I suggest that that is not true.
Do you swim every day?
I cannot decide whether to go or not.
Good for you.
Sami thinks that's so beautiful.
Who owns this truck?
Stop yelling!
Did you read it?
That's your slave, right?
I'm going to show you how it's done.
I forgot to feed my dog.
It is about time we were leaving.
Kiss Tom.
Stop grumbling.
You should've done that with us.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
Stop complaining.
It's impossible.
I cannot bite. I have no teeth.
Have you ever been in New York?
Tom exercised.
Stop crying.
What are you reading?
Why do you want all these?
Nobody cares.
You must be careful.
Somebody was in here.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Do you have a brother, Ana?
Tom is bald.
Where is the notebook that I left here on the table yesterday?
Matoub Lounès is the Kabyle John Lennon.
Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday.
My husband is a good man.
We speak.
Everybody knows that.
Roads are blocked.
I was tired of watching TV.
I hate soccer.
Blimey!
She went blind.
Sami got sick.
Stay absolutely still.
Stop fighting!
I have already told Tom that Mary isn't here.
Don't talk!
Wipe your mouths.
Somebody caught me by the arm.
I hurried home.
I believe you.
Hundreds of people eat here every day.
I know French.
Away with you!
Read it again.
Tom wanted to see us.
When I got up to go to school, the moon was still visible in the sky.
We tried.
Am I making any sense?
Sami sat in the middle seat.
Tom kissed Mary.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Check this.
We wanted to listen.
Someone is watching you.
Have you read that book?
Comfort him.
Tom will be scolded by his father.
Stop crying.
I saw somebody kissing Tom.
They like their Kabyle language.
Almost.
Do you swim every day?
I'll give you a call before I come.
My mother always gets up earlier in the morning.
Tom has built a large house.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not deranged.
It's a golden family.
Are you afraid?
Walk more slowly.
How are you?
You can get in touch with Tom at his home tonight.
Go to work.
I just wanted to get married.
Take your shoes off before you enter.
Can you help me translate that into French?

Does Tom work in Australia?
Why don't you learn French?

Do you think Tom and Mary are ready for this?
Just talk with them.
I won't forget this.
Good night, Tom.
Tom has known Mary since he was a child.
Come anytime.
Tom is going to come soon.
There's one for you and one for me.
Did Tom eat dinner?
When was this song released?
I don't want to leave you.
They have company.
No one is going to help us.
Are you all set to leave?
Keep dancing.
Did you read this?
Tom is always hitting me up for money.

She will do it.
Tom or somebody said that.

Can I take books out?
He walks fast.

Tom is training.
Someone is watching.
I'll come help you.
Are you dead?
Go on.
Tom recorded it.
Tom was quite pleased with himself.
Awesome!
Don't they take care of the dog?
Naomi shifted her bag from one hand to the other.
I hope no one saw us.
You are crazy.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
Do whatever you want to do.
Have a good look at this picture and tell me whether or not you can find me in it.
Stay close.
Tom's outside.
Please don't die.
Talk.
If you don't mind, I'll leave now.
Wash your feet.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Are you shy?
I love you very much.
Nice weather added to our pleasure.
Tom tossed the book on the couch.
Nothing I do is appreciated.
Did you call?
Hi, I'm Tom. What's your name?
Can somebody help?
Hold this.
Tom isn't up yet.
If you think Tom is still in Australia, you're wrong. If you think that Tom is still in Australia, you're wrong.
How slow you are!
Who talked?
What a paella!
You are an idiot!
I'm studying in Australia.
We'll meet again in October.
Tom looked awake.
I hope no one saw you.
Tom was still seeing Mary.
I'm afraid it'll rain tonight.
Thanks!
Tom didn't leave Mary.
It was cool in the shade of the trees.
We are expecting company this evening.
This gift is for you.
Are you writing a letter?
Can't you eat with us?
He hit me in the eye.
Come on.
They are all dead.
Children like to play the hide-and-seek game.
Ask around.
Your sister is lazier than all the other students.
Does Tom have to write the letter today?
Ask Tom where Mary lives.
You can have any you want.
Anything else?
How did they find out about Tom?
Why are they so afraid?
I study.
Please take one.
Form two lines.
He began.
Follow the example of your sister.
Tom's room stinks.
Have you got a dog?
Open your books!
We're truthful.
He has wine.
Run fast!
Somebody must care for the patient.
How lovely!
Tom has until October 20th to decide.
Nobody answered.
Goodbye, Tom.
These objects are very useful.
Nobody hates you.
Be cool.
I want Tom.
She made him happy.
My parents are Kabyle.
He was sitting and reading a book.
He walks barefooted.
Somebody tried to kill you.
I'll eat this if you do, too.
Someone is watching Tom.
What is your greatest fear?
Did somebody mention my name?
Are you envious?
Naomi has just finished her work.
Everything stopped.
Somebody was in here.
Mary knows exactly what she wants.
Everybody knows that he is still alive.
Sami could have murdered Layla.
Are you crazy?
Tom is thinking.
Somebody will see us.
This is not yours.
We left early.
Drink a lot of water.
Are you nuts?
Loosen it.
Bring wine.
Is French difficult?
Stop gawking.
Those are bad people.

Tom is young, but he isn't innocent.
Easy , until we reach a lot of sentences in Kabylian.
Mary is a professor.
I really appreciate your coming.
We think about that a lot.
You are thirsty.
Warn Tom.
It's secret.
I love the sun.
You befooled me.
I'll be getting married in October.
We were kissing.
Can somebody answer that?
You only have to follow him.
Where can I study French?
Tom was kissed by Mary.
You walk quickly!
It's Tom's own fault.
We need you to help us this afternoon.

You run.
This dog is like a baby.
Somebody poisoned Tom.
Keep listening.
Nobody cares who you are.
I know that Tom is a billionaire.
I am cold.
You're a problem.
I didn't lie. You did.
We seldom see Tom riding a bicycle.
Emily read this book.
Keep walking.
I'm not going to hurt you.

She is English.
Can you swim?
You have only to wait here.
Someone had to do that.
Please don't leave me.
I hate him, too.
I have a small house.
I can teach you how to cook.
You're a thief.
I'm certain that we'll do it.
Fly.

Me, too.
I smiled.
Would you mind leaving the door open?

You two may leave.
Look, look!
You look lovely tonight.
Heavy industry always benefits from war.
What are you guys drinking?
I've been in Boston since October.
Hello honey.
Kanji are difficult to read.
Goodbye, we'll see each other up there.
Tom won't help Mary.
Tom talked.
Follow the example of your sister.
You speak tremendously fast.
She might come.
Get dressed.
You're new here, aren't you?
You do not help me.
Take everything.
You have to tell him.
I'll do that if Tom asks me to.
Are you finished?
I love trips.
Tell them that I'm here.
Look out!
Tom needs someone to help him.
I sulk.
Tom wanted to marry Mary.
Somebody stole my lunch.
Someone was here.
Tom found a buried treasure.
Does this dress look okay?
I'm dying for you.
Call me when you land.
Have you been happy in Portugal?
What'll you eat tomorrow?
It came apart.
I can't just leave you here.
I'm a human.
I just received your letter.
Finish studying.
Stop touching me.
You have not heard the children.
When did Tom return from Boston?
Listen well to what I say.
Look at my new car.
Did anybody come?
Let go of me.
I'm on a diet.
Listen here!
Donate blood.
That smells delicious.
This table is reserved.
She loves you very much.
I can't help Tom today.
He went over to the other side.
This is for you.

You may enter.
Tom has built a large house.
Tom always says hi to his neighbors.
Hello, Chicago!
Whenever you come, you are welcome.

Do you think I should do this?
Away with you!
Tom didn't say where he planned to do that.
Not yet.
I ended up winning.
We may need them.
Tom will come with you if he finishes his work.
Watch us.
Sami followed Layla on Instagram and she followed him back.
What people!
I remember.
How are you, Tom?
I asked Tom.
I didn't tell Tom that you were here.
Beats me.
We're expecting company this evening.
Has anything changed?
Don't you think you speak French better than me?
Tom is suffering from insomnia.
Mine's bigger than yours.
Do you think Tom killed himself?
Tom gets to do whatever he wants to do.
Who vanished?
Are you polite?
I understand why Tom did that.
I'll come help you.
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
Do you have any friends?
Did Tom tell you why?
Are you happy?
He's full of shit.
Is he a man?
Prices went up.
Everything came out okay in the end.
Do you know that Zinedine Zidane is Kabyle?
That sounds great.

Many thanks.

Why does Tom want to quit?
Enjoy yourself!
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
Mary is expecting.
One day, somebody will succeed.
Are you busy?
I am a policeman.
What will you be having?
Let me go!
My grandfather loved reading.
Do you want me to call her?
Lalla Fadhma n'Soumer was an important figure of the Kabylian resistance movement during the beginning of French colonization in North Africa.
You are crazy if you continue to work in that place.
Is someone meeting us?
You are mad.
Your face is getting red.
You can always come back.
Nobody knows why.
Are you afraid?
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
I feel very lonely these days.
We met for the last time.
Who talked?
I can't swim well.
Everybody was really happy.
You look beautiful.
Where is your notebook?
He used to meditate in the morning.
You're all crazy.
Give me a cup of coffee.
I got somebody to help me do that.
Beat it.
We eat the meat.
Here's your salad.
May I stay here?
I have faith in each and every one of you.
I'll never leave you, Tom.
A fire broke out during the night.
Examine them.
You're a lie.
Do you know a certain Mr. Green?
I got closer.
My nightingale, you are the one and only love of my life.
He was blinded by love.
They wouldn't tell me how Tom died.
Is someone meeting us?
We had six guests to dinner.
No kidding.
You are an idiot!
I'm a human.
Do you know when the movie "Guardians of the Galaxy" ends?
You make me feel dizzy!
You had better have your hair cut.
Do you still swim?
You are stupid.
Who vanished?
Grab it!
I don't yet know what needs to be done.
Hurry up, Tom.
I'll take you up on your offer.
Don't forget your money.
They hugged.
Keep walking.
I am not breaking anything.
Blackberries are ripe when they become black.
There is not a language without some loanwords.
Are you serious?
The pen Sarah gave me is not blue.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
Keep calm.
He lost his honor.
I want you to get out of town.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
Tom got mad at me.
Tom's brother is a doctor.
Did you hear what they were saying?
I will never forgive you.
Speak more slowly.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Won't somebody help me?
Ask whichever of the boys you see first.
I love winning.
You may enter.
Save them.
Are you Japanese?
Have you decided what you want to order?
Please relax.
You are an idiot!
Have you no shame?
Were you surprised to see her?
Please wash your hands before eating.
Tom said that he'd be back in October.
It seems that we've lost our way.
When did Tom come?
Dry your eyes.
He's always short of money.
Smell this.
Tom is intelligent.
Go find somebody who can help.
Come in.
Tom accelerated.
Tom and I weren't friends.
Is there something troubling you?
Be watchful.
He stood up.
Nietzsche said: Man is something that shall be overcome.
We've all missed you.
Are you lying to me?
That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
This will make you stronger.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were all born on October 20, 2013.
I went on reading.
You're jealous.
I must study.
Tom is anorexic.
Back off.
Does your daughter speak the Kabyle language?
I love this game.
You traitor!
It'll snow today.
Defend yourselves.
It's close to my home.
I hate losing.
I wrote a book about China.
We will start work soon.
He came.
They will find them.
You are mistaken about that.
Come closer.
Thanks very much for doing this.
I'm not interested in your religion.
I think Tom is charming.
Hello, beautiful!
I love Australia.
Be patient!
Thank you for listening.
Since today.
Is she accepting them?
Let him do it.

Tom says Mary has to be more careful.
Mr Tanaka called during your absence.
Tom killed the rat with his cane.
You still don't like Tom, do you?

We'll comfort ourselves with the songs of yesteryears.
Watch your step.
Can I ask a dumb question?
A Mr Smith has come to see you.
Did you get some sleep?
You are an idiot!
Please respond.
Tom was as proud as a peacock.
Are you finished?
Are you handicapped?
Tom told me he would go to Boston.
I think so.
Bring her home.
Taste this.
You alone are my hope.
It's a beautiful life.
Go faster.
They obeyed.
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
I winked.
Please come.
Please don't tell him.
You know I can't.
I have to talk to somebody.
We were reading.
Tom enjoyed working for Mary.
Somebody else might get hurt.
I don't know whether I should believe Tom or not.
Follow Tom.
I want you to work with them.
He came.
Do you like my friend?
Was I wrong?
I'm here because of you.
Let's play something.
Sami was trying to leave but Layla kept pulling him back and kissing him.
Stay away!
Are they still angry?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I think you've been trying to contact us.
She smiled.
Tom likes ponies.
Is this your book?
Who was emperor after Hadrian?
Why doesn't Tom talk?
I hate being sick.
I had to tell somebody.
I've come to talk with you again.
Don't touch.
Tom cannot drive.
Watch us.
Are they hard of hearing?
Tom put his hand out to stop Mary.
Have you ever wondered how many stars are in the sky?
Take life as it comes.
You're wet through.
Tofu goes well with sake.
Tom will protect Mary.
Be happy!
Choose carefully.
Somebody could get hurt.
Tom drove.
I want you to go with Tom.
One never knows whom one might run into.
Tom will accept.
What do you think they should do?
Check again.
You should do that outside.
Sami put the bag on the counter.
Did you read everything?
Tom deserves it.
Move quietly.
Tom's room is always neat.
He promised me to come early.
You stink.
Where were you last spring?
Write your name.
Tom was always like that.
Tom is planning on doing that by himself.
Leave it up to Tom.
Somebody set the fire.
Tom fried an egg.
They talk a lot for nothing!
She forced him to eat spinach.
I give you plenty of money each month.
Make it stop.
Look at my new car.
He cheated on him!
Tom is mischievous.
Switzerland is the country of the railways.
Wow!
Please tell Tom to come in.
Your father is a good-looking man.
He is reading.
We can get one.
He will come to you tomorrow.
Please don't be angry at me.
There's one for you and one for me.
Get ready.
Tom is the first one here this morning.
I guess I'll have to leave now.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
Speak quietly.
You should write a novel.
Will you come with me?
Tom was first one to finish eating.
Tom is rude.
He appeared young.
You are jealous.
This river is very deep.
I can't write that well.
Tom disappointed Mary.
Send this letter by air.
Are you new?
Love everyone.
Tom and I take the same bus to school.
Enjoy your holidays.
No way.
I invited them to the party.
Back off!
Are you ill?
Why does Tom need a knife?
Learn!
Make a decision.
Do you hear me well now?
You should come to Australia.
I'm sick of meetings.
Everything okay?
I want you to go with Tom.
Brush your teeth.
Someone is watching Tom.
Are you hot?
Tom dressed up as a pirate for Halloween.
Is this the dictionary you're looking for?
Always have your dictionary near at hand.
Tom's contract expires October 20th.
I tried to resist.
Call back.
Tom became discouraged.
You're all happy.
Tom felt welcome.
I left my purse behind.
Suddenly he saw me.
I only have one question.
That's your slave, right?
Somebody knocked on the door.
I need somebody to help me do this.
Stop complaining.
Tom makes more money than Mary.
I'm starting the work on the first day of July.
I live in Oslo.
Everyone knows.
I forgot all about that.
You wanted to get your hands on Tom's money.
You can talk, can't you?
Tom said that I can't come in.
Tom only wants one cup of tea.
Tom lost his wallet.
Follow that car.
Don't hold your rival cheap.
Alice smiled.
Come here.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Check again.
Do you know how this works?
Try it.
Send me somebody right away.
Did somebody hit Tom?
I saw somebody kiss Tom.
I thought Tom loved me.
"What will happen to our Kabyle language?" "It will stay ad vitam aeternam!"
You're a dog.
Sami is a good teacher.
Someone had to do that.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
Are you willing to join me?
Is that your brother?
Are you Japanese?
Tom said that he isn't going to sing.
We left on October 20th.
I'm engaged to Tom.
Tom instantly fell in love with Mary.
You speak tremendously fast.
I cannot hate you.
That was hard to believe.
Eat and drink up.
I want to visit Boston in the spring.
Why did Tom ask us that?
Danger, danger!
What a fright I got when I opened the door!
I want more money.
You need to stay away from them.
Who are you?
Tom forgot my birthday.
I want somebody else.
How long will you stay here?
How long will you stay here?
You have only to go there.
Someone's calling.
They are very cheerful.
I know whose book this is.
I have a brother who's the same age as you.
Tom cannot drive.
Did anybody come?
What do you really want to say?
Is this wine?
Good traditions should be preserved.
Have you ever worked with her?
Tom gave the teacher an apple.
Tom speaks.
Paper burns quickly.
Watch closely.
They come from the same town.
We're back.
You could kill someone.
What'll happen to Tom?
I would have understood.
Tom married Mary on October 20, 2013.
Think of your future.
Is it OK if I eat one of these apples?
I'll find somebody.
I think you did that intentionally.
Who drew it?
Tom often borrows books from Mary.
Who resigned?
I'm not your slave!
Sami remembers Layla's name.
I want to rent a house in Australia and stay for a year.
A tea with lemon, please.
Is someone in there?
He laughed.
If he walks, I walk.
We're moving to Australia at the end of this month.
Help me, please.
Learning to speak a foreign language well takes a lot of time.
Call them.
Why did you buy only one banana?
The fleas are wagging the dog.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Sami was wearing my shoes.
Are you unlucky?
Tom can rest as long as he wants.
Tom wanted to avoid Mary.
Take that.
You simply have to call Jean.
Somebody left his umbrella behind.
She kissed me.
Take a bath and then go to bed.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Are you sisters?
Tom doesn't have any idea what Mary is thinking.
Where do you buy your clothes?
Put your room in order.
I love you very much.
Your hour has arrived!
Somebody is lying here.
Tom is a good teacher.
Listen to this!
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
They are making a salad.
Tom sent you something.
Have you ever milked a cow?
Are you good?
Tom said he thought I might have to do that soon.
Read it again.
Just take me home.
Look, look!
If I remember correctly, Tom and Mary got married in October of 2003.
I'm feeling low.
Tom is really jealous, isn't he?
Tom couldn't believe what had just happened.
Red wine, please.
Tom said he'd only talk to you.
That car is quite new.
I don't want to quit.
Get lost!
Be reasonable.
Please tell Tom to come in.
Could somebody get me a spoon?
Circumstances have changed.
I've already explained it to you twice.
Have you read this?
Don't get angry with her.
Tom apologized.
I study Korean.
Let's go to a movie tomorrow.
Why don't you go outside and play?
You refused to pay.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
She reads.
Tom didn't give up easily.
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
Tom didn't help Mary.
Who has it?
Welcome to Tatoeba!
Did Tom tell you why?
Are you prepared?
Tom is whistling.
Leave everything.

That's all she wrote.
You won?
I'll give you something to eat.
Keep writing.
A glass of red wine, please.
It smiled.
Watch yourself.
Tom is happy.
What's your dad's name?
You two go on ahead.
What actually happened?
Do you have a brother, Ana?
Answer me.
I'm not special.
I understood.
When will we travel to France?
Tom died in Boston on October 20, 2013.
How can I know if a boy likes me?
Relax!
I just saw it on the news.
Nobody went there.
Everyone knows.
Have you lost your reason?
The festival starts October 20th.
We never stop learning.
Let him do it.
You're all mad.
They hate the Algerian authority.
You are dead.
Can I finish?
Have some pity on me.
Go sit down.
Stop resisting!
Mary doesn't use salt in her cooking.
Slowly, please.
No one's around.
Your writing is horrible.
You see?
Save us.
You are impolite.
Tom can't help Mary.
So, why are you here?
Tom has three computers.
Tom wanted to do that tomorrow.
You're after Tom.
I'll be leaving in October.
I can't protect you.
Tom and Mary have already kissed.
Where money is master, people are stupid!
Please feed the dog every day.
Tom doesn't eat meat, does he?
I've already told Tom I plan on staying in Australia for another three weeks.
They are words of a value.
Tom and Mary swim every day.
Really good!
It takes eight hours to fly from Zurich to Boston, but only six for the return trip.
Tom was kidnapped.
Tom lives near the ocean, but he can't swim.
Congratulations!
Hey, Ayako, make your voice louder.
Somebody has been sleeping on this sofa.
I cut it into two pieces.
Are you sick?
I saw a dog and its tail was cut short.
Where will you be tomorrow?
His sleeve being hung by brambles, he makes it a pretext to do nothing.
I learn Kabyle through reading and writing.
He died recently.
Away with you!
Take time to eat your meals.
Rest.
Tom enjoyed talking with Mary.
You sound surprised.
No one understands Omar's gibberish.
Did you read everything?
She is dead.
Drive slowly.
Tom vomited blood.
Tom needs the truth.
Study more.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Have you got any free time?
Keep working.
I didn't see Tom anywhere.
I don't know how much it's going to cost.
I'll be thirty in October.
She seems to be living by the lake.
Why have you come only now?
Try to keep Tom occupied.
Nobody knows who killed Tom.
It's almost October.
Tom wanted to meet Mary.
What is over there?
Are you crazy?
No one spoke.
Delicious.
Your request is denied.
Tom can't come today.
He wore a pirate costume for Halloween.
Can I ask you a favor?
Peeling an orange can be tricky at times, you never know if it will squirt you in the face.
Please don't get angry.
Take this medicine twice a day.
I hope no one saw you.
We've all missed you.
I can jump.
Please stay.
Everyone has secrets.
They are like the water and the fire.
I'm not Tom's sister.
I can't do any better.
Tom felt uncomfortable.
Have you finished?
Hey, John.
I'm surprised to see you.
I work at school.
They approve.
Sami is interested in you.
Toward midnight, I fell asleep.
I left you a couple messages.
Watch your toes.
Tom worked for Mary.
Did you check her?
Tom is old and deaf.
Sami still has his guitar.
Tom is going to graduate in October.
Tom blamed Mary.
Do you like my friend?
Follow your dreams.
Please don't get angry.
He is not there.
How about adding a little bit more salt?
Did you do all this?
You are ill.
You look Japanese.
Get real.
I don't want to die.
You swim better than me.
We are brothers.
Tom keeps dreaming about buying a new car.
I was on the road last summer.
Are you wealthy?
I continued singing.
What if somebody saw this?
They always mock others.
They have a problem.
Just talk with them.
I aim to be a writer.
Please.
Did Tom believe it?
They haven't found Tom.
Are you not tired?
Tom will kiss Mary.
You are hilarious.
You are ill.
Mary wouldn't do something like this.
James Allison and Tasuku Honjo won the Nobel prize in medicine.
Melanie likes eating pizza.
Congratulations!
When did you first use a computer?
Can you reach it?
I hope nobody followed you.
Tom didn't know Mary.
How much longer do we have to wait?
Indeed this chair is fine to look at, but it will not stand up to long use.
This will keep you warm.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
Where were you this morning?
Stop crying.
I wasn't scared.
Don't rush things.
Tom couldn't hear Mary.
Come over.
Have you learned cooking or anything?
You see?
You should look up this word.
Tom was angry at Mary.
Did you drink a lot?
None of those books are useful.
There is blood on your hands.
If you had only listened to me, none of this would have happened.
Get real.
I think different from you.
Have you ever been in New York?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Tom slammed the door angrily.
Can you fix this?
Come try.
I got to know her name and her address.
How many computers did you say you had?
Where did you get all those keys?
I'm doing what I have to.
Did somebody mention my name?
Somebody's here.
I might stay in Boston until October.
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
They intend to get married tomorrow.
Stop crying.
Tom is already on the bus.
I didn't want Tom to find me.
The cat which you found is mine.
Water, please.
I'm going to Australia next week.
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Anybody here?
Which one of you is the teacher?
Open your books!
Lower your voice.
Tom is awesome.
This party isn't for you.
Very strange.
Grab this.
I think it's good for you to read this book.
I'd like to eat now.
Tom won't be able to help us.
Please listen.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
I'm glad you waited for me.
"Do you like snakes?" "Of course not."
Is he dead?
She was walking carefully in order not to slide.
How much are you willing to pay for it?
I want to know more about your country.
Everyone is afraid.
You were praying.
Someone unlocked the door.
Tom loves fishing.
I don't wash your car.
You are funny.
I'm dead.
Tom cooked the potatoes.
Thank you for listening.
I'm sure they're wrong.
Would you like something to read?
Away with you!
Tom is with somebody.
Tom waited with Mary.
It's not my native language.
May I say something?
Keep walking.
Tom told me he saw somebody kissing Mary.
Tom shivered uncontrollably.
Tom was happy for Mary.
You're part of the problem.
She kissed him on both cheeks.
Sit down.
Nobody got up.
You must learn from mistakes.
You have only to wait here.
Tom is a good writer.
How can correct mistakes of writing in kabylian in LibreOffice?
Work slowly.
We're trying to help you.
Stop immediately.
You are always complaining.
Tom realized that Mary was following him.
I know that you miss Tom.
I want someone to talk to.
I'll follow you.
Do you want me to call her?
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston since they got married.
I'm a foreigner.
It's the last time I see her.
I told you this is what would happen.
Release Tom.
Does everybody love music?
Hold tight.
Do you come from Austria or Australia?
Tom is beautiful.
I need you here.
Tom doesn't seem to eat much.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
I promise you I'll come early.
Mary loves going out with her friends.
Tom sometimes walks home from work.
Leave me alone!
Sami kept the gun there for his protection.
Somebody must've left it there.
Tell me again who will be helping us.
None of Tom's advice was very useful.
Are you sick?
Your job hangs by a thread.
Please let me out.
I need somebody to help me do this.
Give me a coffee, please.
I hope no one followed you.
Tom and I think alike.
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
Take time to eat your meals.
I tried to convince Tom otherwise.
Tom has until October 20th to do that.
Whom do you expect?
We should go to sleep.
