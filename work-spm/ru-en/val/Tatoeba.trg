I got a message from her.
School begins on April the tenth.
Tell Tom that I'm exhausted.
Did you steal it?
I'm making dinner.
That's terrifying.
Go back.
Tom shouldn't have told Mary his secrets.
I miss Boston so much.
We asked you not to do that.
She is in a hurry because she is late.
I want to marry him.
Don't take presents from strangers.
I thought Tom might be upset.
You sound like you don't want to be an archaeologist.
Is that the way you've been taught to handle tools?
