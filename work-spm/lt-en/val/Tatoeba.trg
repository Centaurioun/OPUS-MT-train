I have to live.
It is worth fighting for future generations.

I want you to sit down.
Make his identikit!
Tom finally ate something.
His son is yelling at him.
They don't know what they should do with the money.
Lying is shameful.
He ran across the street, leaving her alone.

I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
I'm a man.
I don't think it's weird at all.

She'll have to wait for him.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
What has brought you here?
I've learned to live with the pain in my back.
He works eight hours every day.
Who can afford to buy such an expensive house?
Why are you so sad?
Let's sit down.
I'm afraid of the bus.
He lost everything he owned.
This bag is not small.
I think he needs to alter his lifestyle.
I'm too young to die!
I met Tom on my way to school.
Do you travel much?
About how many times a month do you wash your car?

My opinion differs from yours.
I had to go there alone.
I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.

My grandson is the son of my son.
Mary is a police officer.

There is only one day left, whether we like it or not.
You can go to sleep now.
Destroy this temple.
