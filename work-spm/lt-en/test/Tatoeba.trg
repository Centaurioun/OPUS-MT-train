You're in danger.
No, I don't think that I am to blame.

Yuki! It's great to see you again!
I swear, John.
I wish I were a little taller.
It was a complete failure.
Tom will look like an idiot.
Your journey starts here.
This is the last warning.
The coals are burning red.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
No, no, no!
I want to see the streets.
I think it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to escape from this prison.
I learned a lot from him.
Where are we?
I can't predict the future.
I dare not speak to her.
Is this your first time in Korea?
Let me speak to her.
Can you hide me from the police?
I asked her to wait a minute.
The nose knows.

You'll have to cook more food.
She doesn't remember how many plates we have to bring.
Less is more.
Tom isn't currently working anywhere.
It must be done more carefully.
Hear and see and be still.
Don't swim in that pond.
You should be respectful to your teachers.
Where are you staying?
My favorite pastime is strolling along the shore.
Today is a beautiful day.
Tom pretended not to understand what Mary was saying.
Yes! I won twice in a row!
Why did Tom buy that?
The doctor advised that she stay at home.
She walks.
What do you care?
Would you like to drink some tea?
I just don't have much time.

He asked her to stay, but she didn't want to.
He will answer for his crimes.

Do you want me to teach you?
Tom is very rich.
Did you thank him? Did you say thank you?
She washes her head.
I'm not as lucky as you.
He calculated the expenses.
His story wasn't appropriate for the occasion.
He doesn't want to study today.
The room is full of flowers.
I don't like people who get angry easily.
Sit down again, Miss Curtis.
It's exactly half-past eight.
My cousin is a little older than I.
Don't worry, go have fun!
Can you repeat what you said?
The kids are asleep.
You never told me that.
Mark the right answer.
What are you thinking about?
There were ten police officers on the spot.
Give me something to write on.
Well, it's getting late. Let's go now.
Tom asked Mary several times to open the window.
I need a stamp.
Maybe the cat is hiding under the bed?
Would you like to have lots of money?
Japan is lacking in raw materials.
Please relax.
We are flying above the clouds.
You never can tell what'll happen in the future.
I didn't say anything wrong.
All seats are reserved.
Close your mouth!
Without air and water, nothing could live.
I see her sweeping the room.
Answer in English.
Someone stole my driver's license.
The people are playing baseball.
When and where did you come to know her?
I asked them to fix my car.
Ann wrote something on the blackboard.
Life is interesting.
I don't see any connection here.

I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
My language is very complicated.
It's very warm in my room.
Someone opened the door.
You're afraid of him.
You will catch cold.
Tom will need to go further.
May I sit next to you?
I don't care for beer.
I simply haven't the time to do everything I want to do.
It took five minutes to get to the station.
I want to be a teacher.
I can read English, but I can't speak it.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!
I talked to friends.
She works for a hospital.
You are to blame.
This music's annoying everyone.
Green suits you.
I simply don't understand this.
I saw the moon above the horizon.
That old tradition has disappeared.
He wants to go to the United States.
This tour is going to be amazing!
It is similar.
I don't like summer.
You can count on him.
Please drive carefully.
I hear that his father is in another country.
Tom's father is a police officer.
Are you sure?
The telephone was just ringing, wasn't it?
This is not going to happen again.
In this country the average number of children per family fell from 2 to 1.5.
Tony looked down at his dirty old shoes.
She left without even saying good-bye to her friends.
I'm on the eighth floor.
It's a very dangerous system.
We traveled together.
I wrote a song for you.
How do you like this town?
We all found a good place to eat.
You don't have to go there.
I gave Tom a chance.
In the fall, the leaves turn red and gold.
You can't count on him.
I didn't want his help, but I had to accept it.
There are two girls in the playground.
You destroyed the old house.
Doctor, help me!
She became a teacher at the age of twenty.
This is my book.
She baked me a cake.
She slammed the door shut.
I'm very impatient to see the new version of Tatoeba.
Tom started yelling for help.
She turned down our proposal.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
My friend is seventeen years old.
I play with my son.
It was the biggest mistake of my life.
These shoes are too small.
Hello!
It's getting darker and darker.
He fixed the broken table.
Can you take this?
Let me go alone.
You'll be safe here.
I'm Mexican.
You are afraid of death.
Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
I doubt that I'm a good writer.
Where are you going?
This is one of the reasons why I love Tatoeba.
I am terribly hungry.
I don't know which to choose.
He went to the conference.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
Turn left.
I am meeting him next Friday.
In the winter, days are shorter.
Are these yours?
Tom is the captain of our team.
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
Good things come to those who wait.
I'm not a liar.
Your bike is better than mine.
I hate the winter.
His doctor advised him to give up smoking.
Where is my son?
It happened that I was not in London at that time.
Did you see my brother?
There are pretty flowers in the garden.
I made several mistakes in the exam.
I know that you know that I know.
Be quiet, he might hear us.
We'll have to go back.
Ken and his brother are very much alike.
I don't like my school.
Do your homework right away.
How many people are in the store?
This man is alive.
How much does this cost?
I talked to friends.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
I broke her heart.
She didn't like that place.
It is difficult to solve this problem.
You didn't need to hurry.
Do you remember that store?
It's over between us. Give me back my ring!
She asked him not to leave her alone.
They were completely surprised.
He is not an American.
That wasn't my question.
At last, it began to rain.
According to John, the bank closes at 3 p.m.
I work at the embassy.
This part of the report may be left out.
Open the window and let in some fresh air.
That's what he said.
My uncle is coming to see us tomorrow.
She doesn't close the door.
I found my shoes.
This plan will be very expensive to carry out.
I do it every Sunday morning.
She opens the window.
I saw them play baseball.
Tom asked Mary not to drive so fast.
It's beyond my comprehension.
How can I help you?
I am in Paris.
The experiment was successful.
Something tells me that you're hiding something.
I like the green bicycle more than the pink.
I won't deny that.
Do you know Tom's parents?
I was born in Asmara.
How long ago did you start learning Esperanto?
He's wanted by the police.
Stop gawking.
Tom drives.
I am very sorry for what I said.
How deep?
What are you talking about?
Where did you see the woman?
Spring is my favourite of the four seasons.
Did Tom do that?
Good morning!
I found out where he is.
I have doubts.
There is nothing wrong with this.
Sugar is sweet.
Hello everyone!
He thought that I was very tired.
I miss the good old days.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
That's why we are here.
You'll have to pay double.
He seldom writes to his parents.
I swear I didn't see anything.
Kelly brought the matter to light.
No, I don't think so.
Mrs. Smith was a famous beauty.
I don't work on Sunday.
What are you two doing?
Her daughter has a really pretty name.
I ache all over.
Everyone screamed.
Poor cat.
The river flows into the sea.
What do you think she is doing now?
I can do it by myself.
I was a witness.
She has to stop smoking.
Before I get out of bed, I spend a little time thinking about what I'll be doing the rest of the day.
Are you looking for work?
Tell me how you solved the problem.
If you only knew what kind of a situation I am in.
China is a huge country.

I don't think we should do that.
Tom isn't an idiot.
She warmed herself by the fire.
Please continue.
How was your weekend?
Is the human condition flexible enough to adapt to environments beyond Earth?

You can study here.
It's what I want to do.
Who are you talking to?
I'm getting hungry.
Hear me out.
Where's your bag?

Tom is as tall as Jim.
If it rains tomorrow, the baseball game will be put off.
He does not let the opponent come near him.

It was ten degrees below zero this morning.
Who's there?
You'll have to go.
Whose house is this?
I've never drank milk with tea.
Tom got up at 7:00.
I've decided to stop studying French.
The wind is blowing from the east.
Someone has left a bag on the bench.

Open the door and let me in, please.
I found one.
Until next time.

I'm almost sure.

Did you see my mother?
They exchanged gifts.
There's nothing in my cup.
A tiger has escaped from the zoo.
My favorite pastime is strolling along the shore.
Flexibility is one of the many advantages of working from home.
The more, the better.
May I go home now?
We had lunch at noon.
You stink.
We know that all men are mortal.
You have only to push the button.
These shirts are the same. They are the same colour.
Get out of the classroom.
Good question!
You work hard.

What a terrible experience!
Where's the mirror?
What do you want to eat?
The cat seems to want some water.
This table is heavy.

I forgot to telephone him today.
Stand up and introduce yourself, please.
The ship appeared on the horizon.
We were talking to each other all the time.
It's a quote from a book.
Don't you like girls?
Buy a hedgehog and you'll be happy.
I am more beautiful than you.
Stop that!
Today the weather is nice.
I think I understood.
They all laughed at their error.
Don't let the dog sleep in our bed.

She is possessed by a devil.
The cat is playing with the children.
You're the most important person in my life.

Tom wasn't amused.
What team do you cheer for?
Luckily nobody got wet.
He's disappeared without a trace.

What an absurd idea!
Hiroko sat there all alone.
Let's just calm down.

Does anyone here speak Japanese?
Almost all boys can play baseball.

Avoid fried foods for a while.
Tom will need help.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Tom and Mary seem happy.
I'm very hungry.
The boy has an apple in his pocket.

Do you really want it?
You should apologize to her for that.
My father died when I was seven years old.

I hate you with all of my heart.
The same old problem.
It is easy for you to solve this problem.
