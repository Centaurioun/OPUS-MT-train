Did Tom tell you where he put his keys?
You know how important you are to me.
Nonsense!
Take it.
It was really horrible.
I can't decide if I'm happy or sad.
I just got here yesterday.
Can I help with breakfast?
I'm very unhappy just now.
I kept walking to the car.
There's something going on there.
The natural sciences are harder than the social sciences.
Definitely!
Two days ago the wind blew.
She drank two glasses of wine at the party.
It's safer to stay here.
I can't believe that the pizza still isn't done.
That isn't a dog.
There's only one way to live.
What's wrong with you?
What else do you know about that?
It doesn't matter!
The white cat is under the tree.
You're not aiming high enough.
After having a lunch I feel like to sleep.
Could you shut up for a second?
Why are you late to class?
I don't speak Estonian.
Have you told Tom?
I don't want to live with you.
They forecast it will be cloudy tomorrow.
Nobody noticed me.
Does this letter have to be written in English?
I'm in love with this woman.
Perhaps Tom had it coming.
It makes no difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
Tom's looking for work.
Sorry I didn't have a chance to talk with you after the meeting.
Are we expecting any other guests?
I knew before you knew.
Go on.
I would rather starve than work under him.
You seem to have lost sight of original objective.
Literature is the future of a nation.
Who's the manager?
Tom bowed politely.
I'd like a glass of wine.
Give me a day or two.
You think you know me pretty well, don't you?
I'm shy.
Please help me.
Good morning!
I went to America to study.
What does "Tatoeba" mean?
Boys are strange sometimes.
Tom wants to get a part-time job.
I want to drink tea.
The situation worsened.
I can run.
What I remember most about that movie is the last scene.
The earth's moon is a natural satellite.
She's probably very busy.
My name is Ricardo.
I'd like to sleep a little longer.
He's sitting on the bench.
I could say that it is a bit much actually.
He lives near the beach.
I'm writing a letter.
You may begin.
I want another beer.
The bottle is on the upper shelf.
I don't like your suggestion.
When was the last time you ate out?
Tom knows what to say to make Mary forgive him.
Tom doesn't speak French at home.
How long do I have to stay here?
I remember this.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Why are you here today?
Tom and I are getting married in May.
I'll call you after lunch.
Tell me what I have to do.
He pays with a credit card.
Nobody seems to have paid attention to what he said.
Are you going to buy a dictionary?
In winter it snows.
I drink the water.
Cows eat grass.
There's a little bit of water in the glass.
Where's your friend?
You have reached your destination.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Everybody laughed.
Tom was a bit jealous.
I fell.
What're you up to tonight?
Thanks!
I am a vegetarian.
I'm not from Boston.
Whatever!
I'll take the first shift.
We need a car.
Of course!
Hello? Are you still here?
Baudelaire's poetry is magnificent.
My eyes don't work very well anymore.
I'm afraid that Tom isn't here.
I have nothing to do with the matter.
The box was full of strawberries.
The bodies of reptiles are covered by scales.
Life is a gift.
Thanks!
Debbie, is your school near here?
Tom knows how to help people.
I am studying.
What he said was far from true.
This blue backpack is heavy.
Why does the phone have to ring all the time only when I'm busy? I can't get any work done because of it.
Mary's maiden name is Jackson.
One of the children asked one day: "Where do babies come from?"
They won't stay.
Strawberries are expensive in the winter.
Tom said that he had to leave.
I'd like a map of the city.
Morning, sleepyheads!
Like Charles would be my type?
She didn't have any pencils.
I have two cats.
Do you think I still love her?
Can you send me a screenshot?
"I'll get to class on time," I thought.
She is engaged in social work.
Beat it.
I love you more than you love me.
I'm hit!
Nobody came.
Tom claimed that he came from a rich family.
The rules must be few, and what is more important, simple.
He won the lottery.
I can't believe I just said that!
I only wanted to talk to her.
I've just finished dinner.
Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.
I drank a glass of milk.
Tom still hates me.
Who would have dared?
I have nothing to eat.
Tim is a huge fan of satirical comedy.
Tom gives us what we need.
Tom claims he shot Mary in self-defense.
There are many benefits to being beautiful.
Disabled people can't stand being pitied.
What is the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
He has few friends.
Why is Tom so late?
I didn't see that.
I'm afraid of heights.
We heard.
I often study while listening to music.
Was it interesting?
Please don't stand.
I'm wet.
I am an American singer.
Please.
Tom's hands are dirty.
No sooner had Mary broken up with Tom than John was at her front door with a bunch of roses.
His proposal isn't very important.
What do Peter's parents do?
Why should I pay?
Tom was in a car accident.
They drink a lot.
I never imagined meeting you here.
We think it's time to smile more often.
I'm learning English.
What language do they speak in the United States?
Step aside, please.
Tom may talk to Mary if he wants to.
What's your marital status?
Are your children with you?
Tom didn't tell anyone else.
It's a hot day.
Some people think that gambling's a sin.
I don't like the idea, but we'll have to let him choose his team.
Will you join our club?
I barely made the train.
Nobody trusts Tom anymore.
I like eating.
This is the first time I've seen such a big strawberry.
I recognised him immediately.
Sorry...
I just wanted to know if you were in trouble.
What is your marital status?
Does Tom believe me?
You're a very good guitarist.
That's an interesting proposal. I'll think about it.
I speak Irish.
Is that all right with you?
I can barely move my arms.
Africa is the cradle of humanity.
I've never met Tom's wife.
Drive slowly.
Why does it bother you?
Let me taste it.
Wait a moment.
Wake up!
He slipped on a banana peel.
They're wonderful.
I think we should be getting back.
He is such a bad person that everybody dislikes him.
Tom refused to admit it.
I shave every morning.
Is that really science?
Tom has a cute girlfriend.
Finally!
Did everyone go crazy?
This river sometimes overflows after the thaw.
Tom said that he'd help.
Didn't I warn you?
We'll be here for a while.
She's my sister.
Boys are strange sometimes.
There was a great variety of dishes on the menu.
I'm reading this book.
I'm on a diet and would like to know if chocolate makes you fat.
Sure, but let's eat dinner first.
I see.
The post office is closed.
There is an orange on the table.
This house is too big for us.
I want a book. Where is the bookstore?
Yes, I should try to figure out what she is thinking and feeling.
Dunno.
Are you crazy?
I thought you hated me.
I can hear a saxophone somewhere.
Tom couldn't answer my questions.
Tom doesn't go to school by bus.
Tom's not happy with that.
Here is a book.
I'll stay until evening.
How did that happen again?
Tom has a secret.
It's not going to be long.
Don't fall in love with me.
I am a social worker.
I didn't know you were interested.
Sami kept his eyes open.
I wonder where Joe went?
I've only been there once.
I'd like to give it a try.
Don't be afraid to trust your intuition.
Let me see what we can do.
Is there an English-Japanese dictionary on the bookshelf?
I tell you the truth.
Where are your keys?
I'm Chinese.
I want them here.
Where is Hakata station?
Do you like the plan?
I wish I was with you.
We walk among the lemon trees.
You can't kill us both.
I'm not going to tell you what happened until you calm down.
How did I miss this?
Show yourself!
I chickened out.
Tom really got a raw deal.
I went there because I wanted to.
I have a laptop.
Tom turned on the water faucet, but nothing came out.
If you would talk less and listen more, you might learn something.
Please make yourself at home.
I'm going to Germany to visit my boyfriend.
Wash up.
The children sat around the campfire and listened to Tom tell ghost stories.
I have two cousins.
Can I pay with a credit card?
I speak French and English.
What do women really want?
Tom needs a change of pace.
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
How cute!
Who will believe this?
As far back as I can remember, I have had thoughts and ideas which at the time, seemed to make me unique.
The dog is eating an apple.
Tom wants to drink a cup of coffee.
Welcome.
I'm afraid Tom isn't here.
I won!
I should have told you before.
I told Tom it wasn't mine.
How old are you?
Please sing a song.
You must encourage him to try again.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
Do I have to pay you back?
Who's the better driver?
You can do this, can't you?
What do you mean by this?

What's your favorite dessert with strawberries?
Tom is taller than I am.
The cat caught the rats.
I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
I'm a man.
I'm OK.
I'm going to help you now.
Is your mom at home?
I was confused about that at first.
Horses are animals.
I'll take Tom at his word.
Everyone looks tired.
I want to kiss you.
Faith works miracles!
From one year to another year.
I should go now. Bye!
Father is a good person.
I love strawberries.
Where is the hotel?
He is a good student.
Sorry, I didn't notice that.
Goodbye!
My mother loves music.
Without you, I am nothing.
We are all born mad.
I spent three weeks in Boston last summer.
I didn't think you'd mind.
This thing isn't alive.
I am married and have two children.
I can't take you with me.
Open up.
His heart is full of happiness.
What've you done to Tom?
I asked him a question.
May I have your attention?
Who told you this?
Don't you know each other?
I warned him about the danger.
My name is Sally.
Tell me.
I don't have a lot of time. Can you take care of it?
I understand Turkish.
Where am I?
I'm kind of tied up right now.
Does your wife know?
I went to the hospital.
I have three computers.
Good night, Tatoeba. See you tomorrow.
Check, please.
I can run.
Achoo!

Wow!
