I'm taller than Tom.
Maybe next time you'll listen to me when I tell you to be careful.
The cat is reading a book.
I handed Tom my flashlight.
Heather goes to school at eight o'clock.
His answer was negative.
What have they been doing?
Tom is out of his mind.
Help me!
I didn't think you'd show up.
That was my finger.
I spotted Tom immediately.
Hope is not a strategy.
This house is far too small.
Happy birthday!
Careful!
He has more than five dictionaries.
The football player has made a huge mistake.
If you want.
Smoking affects our health.
He's three years older than I am.
I'm happy.
He's the man of the house.
They destroyed the old house.
You can take that with you.
He likes reading books.
Life is beautiful.
Show me.
That apple is big.
How old were your kids when you moved to Boston?
Hello, it's me. Could you come pick me up at the station?
How's your leg?
Come on, Tom. It'll be fun.
Give me the report.
The man is naked.
What were you thinking about?
The boy buys a dog.
I'm 19.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
You have meat.
Achoo!
"Does he like music?" "Yes, he does."
A heavy rain fell.
I have not read all the books.
I want to eat pizza.
This street is dark.
I have a house.
I'm an excellent listener.
The woman drinks the water.
Good morning!
He sold all that he owned.
The evidence doesn't support the claim.
Can you close the door?
I don't speak Irish.
Where do you work?
Finally!
You can't come to Boston with me.
We shall not forget.
Listen carefully.
I agree.
He has visited France three times.
You will pay for this.
I think I have a theory about that.
The train leaves at nine o'clock.
For what purpose?
The box was empty.
I don't know whether he's younger or older than me.
There was a small table in her bedroom, and on the table - a little bottle.
Perfect!
Tom has been a prison guard for ten years.
What's the benefit of this?
Keep it.
It's just a toy.
Mary, come quick! A flying saucer has just landed in our garden.
Tom is alone in his car.
We would have learned Esperanto if we'd had more time.
"Hello," said Tom, smiling.
I think they're right.
I think Tom is objective.
We will have to postpone the meeting.
I'm not always home on Sundays.
You're a smart boy.
During the day, we work, and at night, we rest.
I have to go to sleep.
Terrific!
I think we should celebrate.
Tom is the one with a car.
It is already morning.
No one else knows this.
Tom's squirrel is blind, afraid of heights and allergic to nuts. I don't think that he would survive without Tom.
They quarreled.
What colour is this fish?
Please don't move.
Is there anything special I can do for you?
That's easy to say.
That's apparently not a crime.
I have a 64-bit processor.
How is everybody?
He sat on the bed.
I have a debt to pay.
You're pathetic.
Where is Cornwall?
I'm not a bad person.
I like to play the piano.
What?
You and Tom must be happy.
I didn't have much choice.
Is anyone going to eat that?
Tom overheard our conversation.
Definitely!
Where's Tom today?
Many friends of my youth also came.
I'm Ricardo.
They want to meet you.
My pen is out of ink.
He runs.
This book is not for sale.
What are your thoughts?
Misako married a Canadian last June.
Don't you know?
I want the book.
Tom impersonated a doctor.
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
She began to gain weight.
I'm writing a book.
Take this medicine between meals.
I opened one eye.
Tom chain-locked the door.
The older I become, the less I understand.
What would Tom do if he found out?
Draw me a sheep...
You'd be dead if Tom hadn't saved you.
We want it.
When's this going to stop.
Finally!
This is my book.
How old is the oldest person you know?
It'll be a difficult decision.
Tom won't call back until the meeting's over.
The earth is flat.
Pleased to meet you. I am an anteater.
He is a small man.
An apparently small event may lead to a great result.
Do you like strawberries?
The war began three years later.
Do you know this?
An ambulance arrived immediately.
The most important thing is the ability to think for yourself.
Quieter!
I'm going to check on Tom.
Their son's name is John.
This sounds like the plot of a Hollywood movie.
You run.
I have two siblings.
Have you played that game again?
I have a heart.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
Where's the newspaper?
You've got to do it now.
"Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who in the land is fairest of all?" And then the mirror would always reply: "You, my queen, are fairest of all."
He would have succeeded had he tried.
I will never forget this day.
I'll never leave you, Tom.
It's OK.
Crazy!
He has a sweet voice.
I've still got a lot to learn.
I don't sing.
Why should we help you?
What school do you go to?
Why should Tom want to see Mary?
I don't know what to do about him.
Unbelievable!
They refused to talk to me in spite of my earnest request.
Action!
I'm very excited about it.
Tom tried to kill himself.
Tom and Mary made some gingerbread squirrels.
This watch is broken.
Hold this for me, will you?
Hello. Are you Jackie Scott?
For how long have you been working here?
How long have you two been together?
Just asking.
Maybe I should end this.
It's already been taken care of.
We just need to stay calm.
Forget it.
Precisely!
Are you in any difficulty?
The engine works well.
You may begin.
Did you know this?
The vampire is sucking my blood.
Walk slowly.
Italian is my mother tongue.
Obviously.
There are many factors.
If I can't write anymore, I don't want to live anymore.
We moved the project to a new server.
I really enjoy helping disabled people.
Tom held Mary in his arms.
Tom is already there.
You are not local people.
Go on.
Tom, you've grown so fast.
Will you listen to a piece of music?
Those are my pants.
That was certainly a surprise.
Please say hello to your wife for me.
Tom was standing behind Mary.
Tom grows strawberries in his garden.
I'm at home.
I'm having lunch with my sister right now.
I want a book.
It's a very big social problem.
Tom fixed his clock.
Tom likes you.
The murderer is still at large.
Hey.
A horse can run very fast.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
You're very good-natured.
Something did happen, didn't it?
I read a book.
That's very optimistic of you.
I just wanted to get away.
When we are away from home, nothing gives us more pleasure than to receive a parcel from home.
This is a horse.
All animals are equal.
I want to visit you.
There were no railroads.
I'm not trying to destroy.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
I don't want to go to school.
I brought a book.
I'll pay.
Why aren't you in college?
Get out!
Bees are social animals.
I'm 19.
Please don't interrupt me, Tom.
Today is Sunday.
I'm 19.
Tom failed twice.
I have a lot of work this week.
I live life.
He is very sensitive.
The guests are in the kitchen.
I watched television instead of studying.
I could tell you things about Tom that would surprise you.
Tom said that he would pick me up at 6:00.
Maybe I'll see you around.
How is this even possible?
Please don't interfere.
Are they brothers?
He has a basket full of strawberries.
I forgot to tell Tom.
The house is cold.
I never thought it could happen to me.
You didn't need to hurry.
Tom'll pay.
Wow!
Leaves are falling.
Tom wants to know more about Mary's past.
You should say what you think.
Helen is by nature an optimist.
I talk a lot.
Tom couldn't answer my questions.
You're not afraid, are you?
Help me.
Take it.
Can I cancel this ticket?
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Blah.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
It happened three years ago.
I'm going to get you home.
He would be the last to deceive you.
Sorry, it's not your decision.
I'm sad now.
Did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters?
Tom was visibly disappointed.
Hello, world!
You can do this, can't you?
I have to go upstairs.
Tom, you've got to get up.
What year was your car made?
How did you guess that?
Please help me.
Boys are strange sometimes.
Nonsense!
Mr Koizumi is really full of himself.
I will wash my car.
I love astronomy.
Not a drop of rain fell for a month, so they had to dig a well.
Stop bad mouthing Tom.
What time will you have to go to bed?
Please hurry up!
If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me.
How's it going over there?
We don't need him.
Please hurry. I don't have all night.
Tom has decided to go.
Tom wants to see if Mary likes his new song.
Tom wants to borrow some money.
Something smells good in here.
I have to wait.
What?
I am from Skopje.
Am I not beautiful?
I start tomorrow.
Tom didn't come home.
They have sugar.
A lunar month is shorter than a calendar month.
It's a very important message.
Tom looks like he's drunk.
You are a fast learner.
Tom stopped by today.
Hug me.
The book is on the table.
Maybe Tom didn't do what everyone says he did.
John doesn't know what to do next.
Please hurry.
I know what you were doing.
Do you want anything to eat?
I want to commit suicide.
How about a cup of coffee?
This is my third week.
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
I have a fish bone stuck in my throat.
There's no food right now.
This is not a fish.
Lock the doors.
This is my email address.
This table is white.
Pardon me?
Did you see the eclipse yesterday?
Happy International Women's Day!
I didn't read it.
You're in third grade, right?
Definitely!
See you.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
Good morning, you sleepyhead.
Thanks!
I want to be a linguist.
She agreed with him.
This is a very small book.
My dad is stronger than your dad.
Mary is giving out flowers.
I brush my teeth twice a day.
They are going.
There's someone at the door.
At first sight, the question seemed easy.
What could I say?
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog.
Do I have to study?
You've seen what I can do.
The war lasted two years.
They are too drunk.
The weather is good today.
Do it somewhere else.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
No girl in my class is prettier than Linda.
Good night, everyone!
The bird is in the sky.
Eat, while it's still hot.
Tom is the one who's rich.
Hello everyone!
I asked her to make four copies of the letter.
Get some sleep if you can.
I can't help you with this.
He is a promising student.
You can't do that anymore.
I haven't a very good dictionary.
Please close the window.
It's a fact of life.
It's one of the largest cities in the world.
Don't blame me, Tom.
I will make up for it next time.
He wrote a letter.
Nobody came.
He is only a man.
I lost my wallet.
Ask him his name.
It's too cold.
She is afraid you might be lost.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
The boy I love doesn't love me.
I'm doing the speed limit.
What am I doing?
The dictionary contains about half a million words.
You blocked me on Facebook, and now you're going to die.
I don't have to go-I want to go.
They sound so similar it's not easy to distinguish them.
Mary is a bookworm.
She finds reading boring.
If only you had told me the whole story at that time!
Their wedding will be tomorrow.
Do you want anything?
Bring along your friend.
I bear no grudge against you.
I'd never do that for Tom.
We'll have plenty of food.
I'll try to find her for you.
The film is boring.
I can make no promises.
What's Tom up to nowadays?
Do you want to be my friend?
Which sport do you like the most?
My father takes a walk every morning.
Are you sure she can do it?
I want an apple.
I'm a diabetic.
Tom didn't want anyone to know that he was deeply in debt.
Is it always a sin to tell a lie?
I'm calling Tom right now.
Are you studying?
Don't touch me!
October is still three months off.
I'm a volunteer.
He worked all night so that he could get the job done in time.
I'm awake.
Cheers!
Please don't apologize.
I sing.
Emily is writing a letter.
On your marks, get set, go!
I live in Qatar.
We mean business.
Get up.
Tom is barely alive.
It was raining.
There are a lot of gullible people, so there is a chance that Tom will be elected.
I'll have to live with it.
We are home.
When he smiled, the children saw his long, gray teeth.
I have to wear boots.
I made up my mind to go there.
I need to finish reading this book.
Russia is big.
Tom pretended to be Mary's friend.
I lost.
Goodnight!
I want to go there again.
I wouldn't allow that to happen.
Did they understand?
Turn up the radio a little bit.
I invited my neighbor to breakfast.
My sense of self preservation keeps me from jumping out of perfectly good airplanes.
Almost.
I decided to become a doctor.
I've still got a lot to learn.
Goodbye!
Go back to work.
What?
Haven't I suffered enough?
Hello. May I speak to Mr Johnson, please?
Please.
Did you brush your teeth?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
This is my computer.
This bag is too heavy.
I know how you guys work.
I would like to thank you in advance for any help that you are able to give her.
My father works at a factory.
I was a teacher.
I want you to stay with me.
What's your marital status?
Anybody see you?
What exactly is Tom referring to?
The church bells are ringing.
This is food.
Tom takes piano lessons.
The funeral is tomorrow.
I didn't want anything.
You're on the wrong floor.
I'm not your mother.
I became his friend.
They didn't get along.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
Seen from the sky, the river looked like a huge snake.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
The moon is bright.
Please come inside.
Tom is one of us now.
The seeds have germinated.
I'm playing in the garden.
My wife's pregnant.
Is that what Tom has been telling you?
Every chord, every harmony, every discordant note fills me with immense joy.
I've got it under control.
Please say hello to her if you see her at the party.
What's your favorite soccer team?
Definitely!
Take the medicine three times a day.
Ask me anything!
Yes. The air is very humid.
My brother gave me a cute doll.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
A child not wanting to go to school can be a sign that it's being bullied.
Call me.
I need your help.
Is this a stallion or a mare?
The group tried to solve social problems.
I think we should call Tom.
I wish you were wrong, but I know that you're right.
Let me give you some cash.
Tom was sitting next to me.
Why should you do that?
He will be a good husband.
Tom made that quite clear.
Hello, old friend!
Please hurry.
How's it supposed to work?
Stop!
I like Mary.
It's a pity.
I love chicken.
Happy Easter!
I like the Occitan language.
You would've loved Boston.
Remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened.
They'll arrive tonight.
I'll be with Tom and Mary.
You have things backwards.
Tom got up from the bench.
Anything new?
Hey, leave me out of this.
I wasn't making fun of you.
I have two children.
First, let's talk about what Tom did.
They're very good.
Your apology's accepted.
I know where Tom was born.
Who wrote these?
Wilson clearly had the best chance to win.
Tom has a cute girlfriend.
Keep it.
If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
New York is a huge city.
He has three daughters.
What more do they want?
You don't have to use a dictionary when you read this book.
I saw a dog.
This was her first job.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Hang on.
I have two foreign friends.
Tom is sharp, isn't he?
The chicken is undercooked.
I know this is difficult for you.
Tom smiled at the waitress.
Prohibition is hereby officially prohibited.
We know it now.
I'm flying back to Boston.
I love astronomy.
It's obvious that you're wrong.
Do you have an English dictionary?
Conversation lasted beyond the midnight.
Tom, tell me the truth because I'll find out anyway.
I am sick.
Tom would help us if he could.
There's a message for you.
I saw a dog. The dog held a piece of meat in its mouth.
Hold it!
This is my father.
Drive slowly.
Tom, this isn't about you.
I am tired and I want to go home.
In Hungary I have a friend called Borat.
I live too far away.
Come on!
I am very sorry for what I said.
You're very busy.
They're probably American.
He's a gardener.
I'm not an idiot.
I know you were born in Boston.
Water is a liquid.
This is made in Kazakhstan.
Today I visited a museum.
Do you think Tom is lying to us?
Hungry?
I have three children.
A dog meets a crocodile. The crocodile says to the dog "Hello, fleabag!" The dog responds "Hello, handbag!"
They announced the engagement of their daughter.
Germans mustn't help them.
That long-haired youth is rude.
You're a teacher.
I don't like her face.
Thank you for your candor.
Really?
They will return.
You need not wash the dishes after meals.
I'm trying to write an article.
I want to become a doctor.
Can you make a copy for me?
A jam is made of strawberries.
How long do I have to wait?
The bus leaves every fifteen minutes.
Precisely!
They didn't know.
Chicken!
I have many friends.
This is definitely the best way.
We are all born mad.
How are you?
That's a secret. I can't tell you.
Tom's hands are dirty.
Dan didn't even see the show.
How many calories are in 100 grams of butter?
Tom seems clever.
The cat which you found is mine.
He's not my cousin.
This sweater costs more than fifty dollars.
Take the bags upstairs.
Your house is big.
You have a concussion.
We'll have to postpone the meeting.
I live in Montenegro.
Don't try to do two things at a time.
This sounds like the plot of a Hollywood movie.
She is a beautiful woman.
Tom respects your opinion.
Where are the books?
Almost.
You have to go to school from Monday to Friday.
Only joking.
They moved quicker than horses in gallop.
Everyone will be satisfied.
Let me tell you what I did today.
Listen.
Did you get any work done?
What's going on right now?
We're having a good time.
The lion opened its huge mouth and roared.
The moon is shining.
It looks like the second floor is a banquet hall.
Hello, Tom.
It was here that Tom died.
Tom is making fun of you.
I'm exhausted! I just want to go home, take a bath, and go to bed.
I don't speak French well enough!
Thanks!
I was young and I needed the money.
Sorry...
Are you ready to go?
You know who Tom is, don't you?
I'm very shy.
Fishing is fun.
You've got a fever.
Did you do a background check?
The car is ready.
The bus leaves every ten minutes.
I have not only that to do.
I have five cats.
Is that wrong?
I am pregnant.
If you've never done something so stupid before, go ahead and try.
The nurse is ill.
Tom sings.
Smile.
Which country are you from?
You broke your arm.
We try.
That man is definitely a bachelor.
What's Tom got against me?
I saw them kissing.
I didn't say hello.
The problem is that I don't remember where I've parked my car.
Did you see the sunrise earlier? It was really beautiful.
I'm not sick.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I nodded encouragingly.
Give me back my wallet.
He is a very good doctor.
How often do you go abroad?
Who brought this?
Mary can swim.
The sky looks threatening.
Manchester United won the match, four to two.
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
Listen carefully.
Could you shut up for a second?
There isn't much milk left in the bottle.
John sent me a letter written in German.
Tom is a billionaire.
Hug me.
Her behaviour just isn't socially acceptable.
Tom's thirty.
I confess that I don't understand.
Tom likes most of his teachers.
I want to play.
I have three dogs.
Wait a moment.
He swallowed his pride.
No.
It's not safe to split up.
I need to practice a little more.
What's the problem?
Your handwriting is illegible.
I think it's time for me to admit that I never cared about you.
I didn't unlock that door.
He is seeking a good job.
It's just me who lives with my kids in Urumqi.
Some people think the president spends too much time traveling.
The buses run every ten minutes.
There's nothing out there.
Perfect!
I have two conditions.
They don't stand a chance.
You missed a spot.
Tom is friendly.
At first, I mistook you for your brother.
We have no more rice.
Fill out the application.
Hello, John! How are you?
Pelicans have large beaks.
What train you are going to take?
What makes us human?
Louder.
Tom doesn't eat as much as Mari.
Try to learn some grammar.
How many friends do you have on Facebook?
Her behaviour just isn't socially acceptable.
Who's this?
What's your favorite Harry Potter book?
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Less is more.
Where are the children?
The plural of horse is horses.
Tom is on his lunch break.
What did you end up doing?
I study abroad.
What lies ahead?
Yikes!
Tom is listening to his iPod.
What are you doing now?
I will drink the coffee.
In space, no one can hear you scream.
I couldn't care less about what he thinks.
I don't hold grudges.
We live in peace.
We knew this.
He's three years older than I am.
I live in Japan.
I have no other true friend than you.
The judge sentenced him to one year's imprisonment.
The tumor was benign.
They had to start from scratch.
A cab is waiting.
Beef, please.
Hurry up.
Hello, I'm Tomoko Sato from Japan.
Today is Saturday.
I'd better go talk to Tom.
Definitely!
When is the next guided tour?
The socks stink.
Will you give me some time?
I need only one cat.

It'll only make matters worse.
Whatever!
It's right under your nose.
This castle is beautiful.
Do you like the plan?
She nodded encouragingly.
Are you ashamed of me?
I must say good-bye to you.
Although it was raining, I went out.
Somebody has to finish this job.
Will you sing me a Beatles' song?
Why not?
I have to go.
I'm just teasing.
He has his reasons for staying there.
I've been fairly busy.
How do I get to the bus station?
He ran.
I do it without any problems.
Who are you?
It is a big dog.
Be cool.
They are within earshot.
Tom slammed on his brakes.
I know nothing about women.
Nothing happened.
I want a good dictionary.
I left my dictionary downstairs.
Tel Aviv is a beautiful city.
Listen!
Tom thinks he can save the world.
Dogs are white.
What should we cook?
How cute!
Has Tom spoken to you about me?
I'm going tomorrow.
One language is never enough.
I'm hungry!
Thank you!
Do you know?
Tom hopes you're able to attend the party.
Our grandfather is ill.
Why are you drinking water?
I don't need a boyfriend.
How did it get there?
I've believed in Kylie Minogue since June 12, 1998.
I'll stay until the day after tomorrow.
I have a big house.
Did you two break up?
Afterwards I realised that Charles was not the most important at that time.
Tom stumbled out the door.
The coin is silver.
Don't you know what it is?
I'm Irish.
I'm going to go join them.
Tom wants to say something to you.
I love chicken.
They're probably American.
Just follow your heart.
Didn't you notice it?
Open up.
I'm not mad at you.
Did you bake a cake?
The wind was howling.
She waited for my reply.
I like strawberry ice cream.
Do not open those windows.
I quit.
I can't remember the last time I saw Tom so happy.
She listened to me with her eyes shining.
Tom is the only one here that can speak French.
I'm under the tree.
January is the first month of the year.
Walk slowly.
He is afraid of his father.
Listen.
I have to go now. Bye!
Tomorrow I'll go and play football.
Why?
The boy throws a stone.
Aron killed Elizabeth.
I am Samuel.
Everyone is proud of you.
Do you speak Turkish?
The horse is black.
Look out for pickpockets.
Your shoes are here.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
I don't need your charity.
I'm going to do that.
Tom doesn't like to socialize.
I'm a woman.
Would you tell Tom I dropped by?
I've learnt something from this book.
Everyone is ready.
What will you do this afternoon?
I have to leave you.
We have snow in January.
Tom stood silently.
We were friends.
He's not tall, but strong.
Tom wants to be a diplomat.
Hello. This is Joe Carlton. May I speak to Michael?
Can you give me a hand?
Tom was wearing moccasins.
Nobody will know.
What's so wrong with that?
I don't think Tom is busy.
What's the best way to travel?
What does it cost?
Tom put salt in his tea by mistake.
She keeps her hair in curls.
Tom had the wrong address.
This is a crazy house.
Perhaps Tom had it coming.
I want to write a book.
How could I ever trust you?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Thank you for your invitation.
Doesn't it seem strange to you?
Tom didn't do the dishes.
Don't worry. I won't tell.
Do not reuse.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
Your death will be painless.
Don't ever leave me again.
These ties aren't mine.
I am a widow.
Tom drove away.
We'll solve this together.
I can go there by foot.
Tom broke out of jail.
Hey, give that back to me.
My name is Roberto.
Try on this new suit to see if it fits well.
Tom smiled appreciatively.
Tom is tired of people telling him what to do.
May I have your attention?
Unfortunately, it's true.
I have a lot of dreams.
Who gave you your nickname?
I did good work, didn't I?
I can't get involved in this.
Tom has a family now.
The lamp is grey.
Tom came through the door.
I have three cats.
Squirrels eat seeds and nuts, as well as insects and mushrooms.
You've stalled the engine.
That's just the problem.
I'll fill you in sometime.
The sun shines for everyone.
Where's the bottle opener?
What should I say?
Are nations the last stage of evolution in human society?
Sorry...
A dog's nose is very sensitive.
You are watching.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
What made you sad?
I have two sons.
I have two daughters.
I need to make some changes.
Have some more.
He didn't know that.
I'm going to give it a go.
Is this love?
Play it again.
You are afraid.
I will eat the meat.
I'm at the restaurant.
Do you have any bread?
Mary kicked Tom in the nuts.
Really?
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
Have fun.
I wasn't too sure about it.
I am a college student.
Will you do that?
How're you doing tonight?
I'm Russian.
I wanted to be with him and that is why I left my friends from the background.
Where are the eggs, please?
Tom forged his mother's signature.
It's me!
Take it.
I'm staying with you.
The father is very tired.
All their secrets have been revealed.
What're you up to tonight?
I don't have any other hobbies besides football.
Tom left everything to you.
Tom set his house on fire.
I'm chicken.
To start things off, we encourage you to go to your profile and let us know which languages you speak or are interested in.
Tom doesn't know his own strength.
How many mangoes do you want?
It's just a rumor.
Tom is the only one here who knows how to speak French.
That's basically what we want.
I wonder if he's at home.
Please do it.
Not one was left alive.
The investigation is under way.
Is it enough?
There's nothing back there.
Sometimes Paris exhausts me, but often Brussels bores me. Therefore, I live between the two.
Discussion is based upon mutual respect.
The glass is empty.
You have water.
Why do you care so much about what Tom thinks?
You don't even have a car.
Mary is my wife.
I want a piece of cake.
How are you and Tom getting along?
I'm Tom's uncle.
Tom grabbed Mary's right hand with his left hand.
Go back to work.
Did you guys quit making music?
He became a pianist.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
My dad is stronger than your dad.
Is your bitch on heat?
How did the trip go?
Tom moved a little closer.
Mary is a fairy princess.
Wonderful!
Thanks!
