Is that all your small change?
I do not feel guilty.
What a nice guy!
Are you OK with this?
His theory was absolutely unrealistic.
Tom used to be thin.
We'll share.
He acts like he knows everything.
I can't wait to tell you.
The storm showed no signs of abating.
Where are you going?

There's no food right now.
Are you bored?
That's Tom.
Can you play the violin?
I'm still not impressed.
He boasted of his courage.
The door is closed.
I tried to imagine life on the moon.
You can't let Tom get away with telling lies about you.

Do you still live in Boston?
We don't have a dog.
He wonders if you are afraid of snakes.
I'm glad it worked.
We were cited for breach of peace.
