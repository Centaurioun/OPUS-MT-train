Good evening.
Tom likes fruit.
Sorry, what's your name?
It will rain tonight.
You're on the right track.
You didn't do anything.
I've been very busy lately.
Lift it up.
Does Tom want to go home?
I assume you're the Tom everybody's been telling me about.
Why are you crying?
Are you loyal?
What's your lucky number?
Tom patted me on the shoulder.
Tom doesn't seem to be having fun.
Goodbye!
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
You're obviously sick.
Tom drinks.
This is the safest place I know.
My house is far away.
Have something to drink.
Do you want to help?
Tom is proud of his son.
Have a drink.
I like running.
Did everything go well?
She asked the police for protection.
Have something to drink.
I believe you.
Don't harm them.
Close the door, please!
This is my sister, Mary.
I will be back soon.
I agree with you that we should try again.
Is it yours?
She asked the police for protection.
We can try.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?
Can't we talk about this later?
I know you have it.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Let's eat.
This might be over soon.
They say it will rain.
I don't know.
I didn't strangle Tom.
I am not married yet.
This is a book.
You're obviously sick.
I suggest you don't ask Tom that question.
What time is it now?
Look over there.
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
Tell me again.
Can you tell us your name?
I don't understand.
Are you sure?
Where do you come from?
She smiled.
Do you speak English?
Is it yours?
Do you want to know?
I'm hungry!
It's none of your business.
You've made Tom unhappy.
Close the door, please.
Do you want to do it together?
Tom fell into the water.
You are my friend.
All Tom wanted was for Mary to love him as much as he loved her.
What's your first name?
I'm here to help you.
It's late. You have to go home.
Your idea sounds like a good one.
The towel is in the bathroom.
I don't want to go to school.
Are you sure?
What's your favorite thing to do?
I don't understand what you want.
Where are you?
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.
I told Tom to do it.
I should go to the party.
We got robbed last night.
I know you're probably wondering why I'm here.
They were dying.
How many Christmas cards did you get last year?
Tom told Mary that her boyfriend was looking for her.
What's your favorite thing to do?
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom isn't very talented, is he?
It is sunny today.
I have food.
See you later!
Come dance!
I'm the one with the money.
What do you want?
Tom is really lucky.
Next February, I'll be going to Australia for one year to study.
Please come here.
Tom and I have that in common.
How long did you stay?
Did I give you that impression?
Maybe Tom's got something to hide.
They obeyed.
I understand.
How do you say XXX in English?
I love you.
Is that your first name or your last name?
What is your name?
Could you send me a picture?
This is my sister, Mary.
Don't go near this dog.
Do you speak English?
I prefer to work on my own.
Can I help you?
I want to eat.
I want to say goodbye.
This might be over soon.
Tom should be there.
They were dying.
You've never seen one of these before, have you?
Let's ask.
How about you?
I want to go.
She was swimming.
I didn't give Tom anything.
There are islands in the sea.
I love to skate.
We walked to the river.
You may write in any language you want. On Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
We met for lunch at Chuck's Bar and Grill.
Say it again.
I have two cousins.
Are you Japanese?
I think you should see this.
I am not married yet.
Do you still have a gun?
Sorry for being late.
I nearly forgot it.
Tom thought that you were in Boston.
There are islands in the sea.
Show me how.
Do you want to eat?
What's he doing over there?
I'm the one with the money.
What kind of gift do you want?
Tom danced.
The book is on the table.
"I've been busy." "Busy doing what?"
I am in London.
Tom looked annoyed.
I eat fish every week.
You're a tease.
We needed a break.
Hurry up!
It's about to rain.
Tom's a very bad guy.
I know you want to help Tom.
Why?
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Drink something.
Muiriel is 20 now.
What are you cooking?
Tom died with a gun in his hand.
What is your name?
I want to run.
I think what Tom is doing is great.
Please forgive me.
I am not married.
Merry Christmas!
I borrowed it.
Do you want to go?
I don't want to think about what could've happened.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
I'm sorry for making you cry.
I drink.
Tom found that.
How many eggs could you get yesterday?
Please forgive me for being late.
Excuse me.
What are you eating?
It's cold.
I designed it myself.
If you want to come over, call first.
I'm a student.
Let's play.
I like tea.
What would you like to eat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
Tom and Mary went fishing together.
Wait for us.
It may rain.
We haven't finished doing that.
I wish I knew what happened to Tom.
She smiled happily.
They smiled.
When are you leaving for Rome?
What's Tom doing today?
Why are you angry?
We're still investigating.
I gave Tom some money.
It was raining.
I love you.
Tom couldn't make an immediate decision.
I don't want to think about what could've happened.
Why don't you give me a ride?
Come and dance with me!
Are you in London?
I'm thirsty.
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.
Where do you live?
Go away.
He's not breathing!
I prefer to work on my own.
Stand up!
He was alone in the room.
I didn't know Tom lived here.
Don't you recognize it?
I like languages!
They swam.
Tom is extremely outgoing, isn't he?
My name is Jack.
Please sit down.
He walked to the house.
I don't speak Japanese.
I also had a very good time.
I am at home.
Welcome.
Tom wasn't consulted.
I have two cousins.
That is essential.
I can't meet you now.
Many people are still missing.
Do you want to play?
Do you feel safe here?
Mom will buy us a puppy.
Goodbye!
You don't have to explain.
Let's go!
This sounds interesting.
Tom has been busy at work.
Let's walk.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have a pen.
Can you please repeat what you just said?
Tom is tempted.
What happened?
