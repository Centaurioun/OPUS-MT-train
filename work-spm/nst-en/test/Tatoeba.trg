I like to run.
Welcome.
Tom must be Mary's boyfriend.
You've never seen one of these before, have you?
I can't get rid of my cold.
This is my sister, Mary.
Tom hid himself behind the curtain.
I've been saying the same thing.
Excuse me.
You have many books.
Tom couldn't decode the secret message.
Stay quiet and be alert.
What's your full name?
It's hard to say what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
We're eating popcorn.
I am not a doctor.
Please come here.
I know you are struggling.
In time, you will understand.
Tom is seldom late for appointments.
Do you want to sleep?
You are beautiful.
What's the time?
Tom is really lucky.
That's no way to talk about Tom.
Tom was surprised to see John and Mary out on a date.
What's your full name?
Tom lives in a small town where nobody locks their doors.
How long did you stay?
We do very demanding work.
It was so beautiful.
Does she have a passport?
Let's ask.
The queen stood beside the king.
I am eating rice.
I knew you'd been studying French.
Is that what you told Tom?
Tom has completely recovered and can go back to work.
So what?
Tom is tempted.
We can try.
Tom thought you were in Boston.
He was born in the 19th century.
What's in the closet?
My dream came true.
I am married.
I am eating fruit.
Tom is a lousy dancer.
I also feel the same way.
She's got a point.
I've been working on this for three weeks.
Are you enjoying the holidays?
Who are you?
I am in Tokyo today.
Tom is busy now, so he can't talk with you.
Don't be afraid.
What's your first name?
It was a funny moment.
I have a headache.
What can they do?
This is never going to end.
Let's eat.
Do you drink coffee?
I'm so fat.
Why don't you give me a ride?
Thank you for today.
Why didn't you just call?
I don't like horror movies.
Come with me.
What are you doing?
I like seeing you this way.
Tom enlisted in the Army.
It's still for sale.
Let's celebrate!
Please forgive me.
Do you love me?
Happy New Year!
Why are you sad?
I must repay my debts.
She is helping him.
I like apples best.
It's a compliment.
Tom couldn't decode the secret message.
Come with me.
Tom looks amazing.
She smiled sadly.
How much does this cost?
Tom folded his clothes and put them in his suitcase.
China is bigger than Japan.
I don't understand what you want.
It seems that Tom only eats fruits and vegetables.
Why didn't you just call?
Do you want to go to the hospital?
Tomorrow is another day.
Do you speak Japanese?
I borrowed it.
What can they do?
Do you want to do it together?
I am running in order to catch the train.
Many people are still missing.
I miss you.
What is in the garden?
Tomorrow is another day.
The password is "Muiriel."
You're obviously sick.
I am a vegetarian.
This might be over soon.
What time is it?
No.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
You are very brave.
Open your eyes.
What are you thinking about?
I think about her often.
Tom is always in a bad mood.
I run quickly.
I am not a doctor.
In time, you will understand.
I'm sorry.
It's late. You have to go home.
Who's the party for?
Come with me.
How did you like Boston?
I really do think that.
What did you say?
Tom can't come in.
I put some milk in my coffee.
I just don't know what to say.
Water, please.
Smile.
Tom betrayed Mary.
Does Tom know French?
Did Tom say why he gave it to you?
You should sleep.
We went to the park to play baseball.
I know you want to help Tom.
Let's work.
God bless you!
We do very demanding work.
This is my computer.
Where is the tree?
They were swimming.
Tom is our friend.
I saw the girl.
Tell me.
I don't know the rules.
Good night!
It's late. You have to go home.
Many people are still missing.
Are you a student?
You're both awfully quiet.
She never saw her brother again.
Hello, what's your name?
We had to make the best of a bad deal.
Tom hasn't seen Mary in three years.
I am not married.
Where is your father?
I run every day.
We learned English.
I have a cat.
Nobody seemed surprised.
Several students in the back of the classroom laughed quietly.
Come here.
Tom asked me who had painted the picture.
Tom looks amazing.
I agree with you.
What are you talking about?
It's none of your business.
Do you want to rest?
Don't let your feelings show.
You are tired, aren't you?
If you want something done right, sometimes you've just gotta do it yourself.
Is competition good for kids?
I checked my watch and realized I was an hour early.
I didn't go out because it was very cold.
Tom sent me here to protect you.
Do you have a car?
Don't worry.
What are you doing in my room?
I have a stomachache.
Don't feel bad.
Why are you afraid?
Tom invited me over for dinner.
Why didn't you just call?
I was quite annoyed.
Betty killed him.
I'm eating dinner with my husband.
I have been busy.
It's none of your business.
They lied to us.
We learned English.
I forgot my email address.
Go away.
Where are you going?
Does Tom have a crush on Mary?
You've made Tom unhappy.
You don't have to explain.
It's late. You have to go home.
Can you tell us your name?
Please let me know your new address.
You are very brave.
Why did you call me?
Shut up!
There are islands in the sea.
It is raining.
Why would anyone care?
Tom is extremely outgoing, isn't he?
You must control yourself.
I also had a very good time.
You're welcome.
What are you doing?
I wanted to steal it.
Does Tom want to go home?
You look very dignified.
You must control yourself.
I am married.
This is my sister, Mary.
Are you married?
It was so beautiful.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
I am eating lunch with my sister.
As you say.
Would you please open the door for me?
Let's eat.
He was born in the 19th century.
Tom and Mary took a long walk through the countryside.
Tom's wife's pregnant.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
That stuff is poisonous.
I don't want to go to school.
Tom and I have that in common.
He doesn't look his age.
I am in Rome now.
This is my sister, Mary.
I don't have any money.
Do you feel OK today?
I have to get some money out of the bank.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
Tom is our friend.
No way!
Thank you.
We can try.
Those who want to stay can stay.
I thought it might be useful.
The wound has not healed yet.
Tom's voice is unmistakable.
Does Tom want to go home?
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
What are you doing in my room?
Are you winning?
Tom didn't know what to do next.
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
Look here.
Tom asked John what Mary's last name was.
What happened?
Are you hungry?
You can believe me.
I don't see the relevance.
Don't worry.
Have you seen this man?
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
I like to walk in the rain.
People were lined up to buy tickets.
I also feel the same way.
I've been busy.
I warn you not to do that again.
Would you please open the door for me?
Why are you afraid?
We are learning Spanish.
Tom and Mary went fishing together.
Many people are still missing.
An investigation is ongoing.
Are you on Facebook?
Am I allowed to be in here?
Good night!
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
Do you drink coffee?
Don't be afraid.
Tom was lucky that he didn't get killed.
I have to leave now.
I want to dance.
Please forgive me for being late.
My grandfather no longer drives.
We got robbed last night.
I am not married yet.
Thank you for your help.
Tom can sing very well.
Come here.
It was so beautiful.
Tom is a very nice boy.
Tom is now living in Boston.
Good day!
I'm tired.
Call the police!
Look over there.
I met him several times.
I understand.
Hello!
Where do you come from?
Don't worry. Everything is going well.
I think I can probably speak French better than Tom.
Why are you laughing?
Tom congratulated Mary.
You didn't do anything.
Do you want to eat?
You danced.
Can I take a picture of you?
I want to know.
The boy who came yesterday was my younger brother.
Do you still have a gun?
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
I'm going to go.
I cried reading this book.
Calm down.
Thank you for coming.
She asked him to marry her.
I am eating rice.
I have a car.
What do you want?
It's just a guess.
I wasn't aware Tom had done that.
I am eating dinner with my husband.
I am taking a rest in my car.
I want to say goodbye.
Are you married?
Thank you for coming.
Tom broke something again.
He doesn't look his age.
We're persistent.
We needed a break.
Thank you for coming.
Are you on Facebook?
I've got everything I need.
Where do you come from?
What are you looking for?
Are you at home?
It's not that bad yet.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
Where is your school?
I have two cats.
I like languages.
I was upstairs.
How old are you?
Thank you for listening.
Thank you for the suggestion.
I want to learn.
Let's walk.
Don't you recognize it?
Do you understand me?
I'm proud of you.
I smiled.
If you want to come over, call first.
How long have you been here for?
Why would I want this?
I also had a very good time.
Tom is very chatty.
Tom doesn't tell stories very well.
Are you all right?
Am I allowed to be in here?
I am not married.
Why are you dancing?
Show me again.
Yes.
Tom found that.
A fly fell in the soup!
This is the book that Tom was talking about yesterday.
They were dying.
You're Tom's students, right?
Come on Monday afternoon, if possible.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
Are you happy?
Show it to me.
Tell me!
My brother is a good skater.
Tom sent me here to protect you.
Do you live here?
I don't understand.
I think Tom dyes his hair.
Tom enlisted in the army.
I have money.
Tom is already sound asleep.
How old are you?
It's a compliment.
You must control yourself.
I can't meet you now.
Who told you about this cave?
Do you really want to be a soldier?
I also feel the same way.
You should sleep.
Come with me.
This is my sister, Mary.
Go away.
Please sit down!
Tom looked a bit sick.
I come inside to drink coffee.
I like learning languages.
We appreciate the warning.
I don't agree with you.
We're persistent.
Look at this!
Drink something.
Do you have a contingency plan?
I need you.
She has absolutely no enemies.
Come with me.
He seems to be rich now.
What?
I should go to the party.
Are you enjoying the holidays?
I like fish.
Who's the party for?
Thank you for everything.
I want to go.
Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?
What kind of gift do you want?
It was no coincidence.
How are you?
She doesn't want to be with anyone.
She doesn't want to be with anyone.
Tom tried to keep calm.
What did you order?
Do you remember me?
She often sits there reading a book.
What does he do?
Let's go!
Tom has been studying French for years.
Tom hasn't seen Mary in three years.
Tom bought the whole nine yards.
I want to cry.
Do you speak Italian?
What do you think I'm going to do?
I like dogs.
Well done!
Come with me.
I am married.
It's not a virus.
I think you're right.
You won't be the only one there.
Tom has no money in his pocket.
The boy didn't have an appetite.
Happy New Year!
Come eat!
Do you need more time?
Good morning!
I can't share it with anyone.
Tom has completely recovered and can go back to work.
Are you married?
Happy birthday!
You can do it.
Who is your teacher?
I know.
What's this?
I have two cousins.
They were dying.
It took time.
Do you want to go?
Let's not talk about this today.
Goodbye!
We need to be more aggressive.
OK, I get the idea.
What's your full name?
Thank you for coming.
Are you two ready?
It wasn't that expensive.
No.
Tom always seem to be in trouble.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Why don't you call me Tom?
How do you say XXX in English?
Cheers!
Tom hasn't seen Mary in three years.
Let's eat.
Let's dance.
I don't have any clean clothes to wear.
In time, you will understand.
Tom has written a few textbooks.
Can you help me?
Tom was surprised to see John and Mary out on a date.
She doesn't want to be with anyone.
Just tell me what it is.
I think it's really cool.
How old are you?
Hurry up.
Can I take a picture here?
Tom is extremely outgoing, isn't he?
I can't live without you.
Thank you for the present.
Tom was late for the bus.
Where is Tom?
Didn't you hear the doorbell?
Are you married?
My brother is a good skater.
Tom told me that I was thirty minutes late.
Tom made it quite clear what he didn't want us to do.
I have children.
Where are you from?
Have you got a car?
You needed me.
Are you sure you don't need my help?
Tom often wears black.
They obeyed.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm busy with my homework.
You look very tired.
Let's go out before it gets hot.
They lied to us.
They lied to us.
Come on Monday afternoon, if possible.
Let's dance.
I couldn't keep lying to Tom.
I told Tom to do it.
It wasn't really a plan.
Let's celebrate!
Everything's quite satisfactory.
What is the time?
That was naive of me.
We can use force if we have to.
It was sunny yesterday.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
Do you have a cellphone?
I don't think Tom can do that.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when writing in French.
Tom and I are going out for a walk.
Many people are still missing.
Where does it hurt?
Tom still has a few options.
Let's hope you're right.
Let's play.
How have you been?
Who is your teacher?
Well, it's complicated.
Tom peeled the carrots.
Don't bother me.
Do you want to go to the hospital?
I know it for sure.
Tom ought to do something for Mary.
I think, therefore I am.
I am eating a banana.
I hired a guide.
I have to go to sleep.
Are you ready?
Are you tired?
Look!
What is it you want from me?
Tom loved us.
Tom is very chatty.
Thank you.
It wasn't that expensive.
Tom is a reasonable person.
What's your name?
This word comes from Greek.
I like dogs.
Let's work.
Congratulations!
