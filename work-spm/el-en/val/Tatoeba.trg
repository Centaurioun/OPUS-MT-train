You'll have your turn.
My father is tall.
Jiro is not here.
I'm not very good at this.
Does she speak English?
You're a liar.
Nobody bought it.
You'll see Tom.
Did Tom do this to you?
Tell me something about Tom.
I told Mary I wanted a divorce.
She died quickly.
You are not a student.
Don't leave me alone.
Do you have any information about that?
We'll try it.
I really don't have any questions.
Tom will probably have a heart attack if he doesn't slow down.
This woman lied to me.
Tom was fired last October.
Give me the pen.
I'll watch TV.
We were busy.
I'll show you around the city.
He likes to play cards.
I wonder what I need to do to find a job.
This bicycle is mine.
I don't know him.
Tom ate breakfast all alone.
Have you fed the horse?
How's the wife?
I have no idea.
The rumor isn't true.
Let me finish.

Nothing is ever their fault, is it?
Where did it go?
Terrific!
We have no choice but to fight.
Did you invite them to the party?
Who are you talking to?
I'd buy it if I weren't broke.
These are tears of joy.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
Please help Tom.
Tell him I don't want to go.
Tom is a psychotherapist.
I'll try to find them for you.
You will die.
I never hit Tom.
Tell them you don't need it.
I can't forget her look.
This is Tom's car.
Did you hear what he said?
Are you feeling tired?
There! She comes!
I met an American girl.
It appears that you're all mistaken.
I wasn't honest with Tom.
Do you want my help or not?
Do you like French wines?

I never trusted you.
The problem isn't you.
I married a Canadian.
I'll see you later.
She left early.
This is true.
It's a waste of time and money.
I bet he isn't telling the truth.
Help us.
The tree is crooked.
Do you like cheese?
Who's your favorite?
Tom has worked in Australia.
He knows neither me, nor you.
Send me a postcard.
Were you crying?
You're sick. You have to rest.

You look busy.
I don't know how Tom got here.

You heard what I said.

When did you get up?
What size shoes do you wear?
Tom thanked Mary in French.
She's from France.
They went to Boston.
They're Canadians.
I would like her to give me an explanation.
I don't feel safe here anymore.
Happy Thanksgiving!
I love you, sweetheart.
Where did you feed them?
She promised she'll check on it.
I'm usually pretty patient.
Do you like coffee?
What? I can't hear you.
Drink something.
I think I hear them.
Did you kiss her?
Your teacher asked you about what?
I'm no longer friends with Tom.
Your child peed in his diaper.
They seem moved.
They wanted to steal the car.
Tell them why you can't go.
Tom said they were lucky.
Life is short, though a smile only lasts a second.
Up to that time he had been staying with his uncle.
We were all wrong.
Tell her we'll be ready.
These cars are made in Japan.
You're stronger than him.
Tell him you're not ready.
Tell her to help me.

Do you like tennis?
Shall we meet at the library?
We need volunteers.
Tom can handle French quite well.
It brings me great joy.
No, that's all.
Are you prepared?
My father loves my mother.
She looked in her bag for the key of the house, but could not find it.
You're sick. You have to rest.
Give me a towel.
Is he a good person?
I thank you.
How many have you killed?
Tom broke three dishes.
Are you having fun?
I expect your help.
They will fix it.

She punished her children.
Tell them we're busy.
Don't forget to talk to him tomorrow.
You're unbelievably stupid.
Do you like chocolate milk?
You're twisting the truth.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
I want to see them again.
Pink roses are beautiful.
I do not believe it.
I have a grievance about that, I believe it was unfair.
She's lying.
I'm not your teacher.
Take them with you.
She asked them to take their shoes off.
What Tom told us yesterday didn't make much sense.
Did you lose?
Where are you heading?
I have two cats.
Do you like these earrings?
These books were expensive.
Tom read thirty books last year.
Do you like to sing?
Tom started coughing.
You're young.
My dog is smaller than yours is.
We shot him.
You'll stay here tonight.
Greece has many islands.
Her question is very hard to answer.

Whenever I hear this song, I think of Tom.
This book is very small.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
Can you read it to me?
Do you have any plans for next Monday?
Forgive me.

I can't forget her smile.
Thou speakest.
If I weren't broke, I'd buy it.
Tom's dog loves people.
I like eating pineapples.
Tom just got back from Australia.
What in the world does Tom mean?
We'll talk here.
I married a Canadian.
Tom felt uneasy.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
Stay still.
If you have something to say, say it.
That's a good idea!
I don't want to talk about it right now.
He's very much interested in the Japanese language.
Tom knows.
Tell her I'm coming.
Mary wore a simple dress.
I won't move.
I think I hurt his feelings.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I have not seen him in months.
I thought you were Canadian.
The other girls teased her about her clothes.
One language is never enough.
My house is near the school.

No one slept that night.
Tom opened it.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
Can I borrow your notes?
Everything's going to be OK.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Where is the bank?
Are you angry at me?
Make yourselves comfortable.
The party's on Tuesday.
We'll fix it.
My strength is draining away. I'm losing consciousness.
Do you like Mozart?
Tom accused Mary of theft.
I was overweight.
Good morning!
You don't understand.
See what I did!
She was the last customer.
It seems to me that you should be able to do that by yourself.
You'll be busy.
I should drink tea.
Throw him out.
It's too noisy here.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
Why is that baby crying?
You are taller than me.
Tom brought Mary a gift.
I've made a correction.
I must help her.
Tell them you'd like to help.

Where's your father?
They will fix it.
Let's make it brief.
Tom didn't give it to me.
Open up.
I'll try to find one.
I want money.
You're very smart.
We had lunch at a little coffee shop.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
It's terrible.
She was the last customer.
I need my tools to fix it.
If you don't like this, I'll get you something else.
What will you have?
You are not Japanese.
You have tons of friends.
I'll try to find them for you.
I fell into the water.
Tom's condition is deteriorating rapidly.
They're washing their hands.
I don't know where to park.
It smiled.
I want you to sing.
Tom and Mary live together, but they're not legally married.
I now know the truth.
Tom didn't stay with us.
I just got back from Australia.
This is the worst place in the world.
I'm so happy to see you again.
What's the title of your new book?
I helped him yesterday.
I'll be ready on Monday.
Hello!
It's not Monday.
They will fix it.
There are two possible explanations.
She works alone.
Tell them it's important.
The dog is jumping.
The girls are shy.
His fever subsided.
Everybody's happy.
I doubt that we'll be able to prove that.
This is not my key.
They claim they're Canadians.
I won't lose!
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
You're better than them.
There is a glass on the table.
Tom would get angry if I did that.
Why not try talking to the police?
They'll find it.
It was expected.
Why should I stop them?
Don't talk so loud.
Tell them to write me.
Why are you so sad?
Tom was very decisive.
Tell her I'm in the office.
Tom's fast.
My car is in bad shape.
Do you like to drive fast cars?
You have three choices.
We're not afraid.

Catch him.

It was an accident.
He became famous.
I've got to get back to work.
You're older than me.
They are not alive.
Stop talking.
I'm free.
Do you like rap?
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
Do you have any?
Keep the change!
Tell them you can't do it.
Tell her that I'm ready.
We have known her for years.
Your shoes are here. Where are mine?
You're going in the wrong direction.
I play with him.
Tell them I'm busy.
Come here right now.
He's using you.
What did you ask him?
They need volunteers.
Until then.

I couldn't control my anger.

Don't take your mask off.
Do you know who he is?
