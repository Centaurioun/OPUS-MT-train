You're mine.
The girls won.
She is addicted to alcohol.
Tom made a lot of mistakes.
From which direction?
Let me make my position clear.
You have two flowers.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
Tom showed Mary the poem he had written.
We're ready to help.
Why did you marry him?
Are you prepared?
Where did he go?
You're unpredictable.

She is from France.
We are not ready.

You'll feel better.
She went to America.
Did you like Boston?

I never go to bed before midnight.
Everybody smiled.
Aren't we lucky?
You promised you would come.
The father works.
How many people are in there?
Do you play tennis well?
Do you think this is a game?
Tell her to help us.
Can I?
Tom'll die.
A sentence is never innocent.
That is the solution.
The negotiations have begun.
I lied to you.
Sweet dreams!
Nobody lied.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
Tom was waiting for you.
We were both very thirsty.
That bridge isn't long.
I'm a lifeguard.
Tom painted his room white.
My name's Ricardo.
We leave in half an hour.
He is watching TV.

Could we talk in private?
It's very pleasant here in the mountains.
We live in Boston.
I want to answer the last question first.
Boston is changing.
Tell her to write me.
Tom is better than Mary.
Tell them why.
Tom listened.
They lied.
Are you homeless?

I called him.
We are Australians.
Give me a little time.

Can you speak French?
I want to speak with Tom.
How come you are here?
I like his picture.
I won't stoop down to his level.
Say it in English.
Tell him thanks.
It's so nice here.
It is ten degrees below zero now.
I washed my feet.
If you do that, you're going to look ridiculous.
Are you an only child?
Tom kidnapped Mary.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
Tom left Boston.
I'm sorry for the late response.
I'm a diabetic.
Certainly.
Tom isn't helping.
I know you think you understood what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realized that what you heard is not what I meant.
Who sent them?
I waited for them.
The dog fell asleep on top of the blanket.

Tom left a note on the kitchen table.
Where is the post office?
It seems to me that you should be able to do that by yourself.
How much are they paying Tom?
He makes me laugh.
Today is Sunday.
Kiss Tom.
No matter what you say, I won't change my mind.
The men are eating lunch.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I'm not perfect.
He's the only person she can trust.
I will be here until you return.
Do you know Tom?
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'll bring them to you.
Are you busy on Monday?
Tom will kill you.
Who's your favorite Canadian musician?
He smiled.
Vectors need not correspond to a physical quantity; anything can be a vector space as long as vector addition and scalar multiplication is defined.
You're fired.
I am very worried.
I told it to my friends.
My homeland is the whole earth.
I didn't want her to see me like that.
Me, too.

There is no Plan B because there is no Planet B.
Tell him you'd like to help.
Tom will pay.
Who cares?
I don't need your help.
Tom trusts them.
Birds of a feather flock together.
I had three options.
I wish I'd been born Canadian.
It wasn't until yesterday that I found out the truth.
Come quickly.
I can't reach the transom.
I want to do some sport.
We have to make a decision.
Do you like rap?

That story can't be confirmed.
There are exceptions.
What's really going on between Tom and Mary?
"Don't say such rubbish!" said the farmer.
The real heroes are us.

You can sit if you want.
Did you say anything to her?
I can't make you any promises.
I can't find time to read the book.
Can you take me to this address?
Are you texting her?
Tom is mentioned in the book.
Tom and Mary are at home today.
These are gifts.
Tom doesn't seem to be a Canadian.
I like to speak Welsh.
I'm not Canadian.
Do you ever sleep?
Are you alive?

When I was sick, Tom came over and cooked dinner for me.
Tom waited, but nobody came.
I refuse to allow it.
Tom is vulnerable.
Tom has come back from Australia.
We miss him.
Where's the cook?
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
I'm going to count to three.
Would you give Tom a message for me?
Wait for us here.
Behave yourself, or you'll have to leave the room.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
You should be grateful.
The cat is under the table.
I've never seen her.
Tell them thanks.
She didn't answer.
You're old enough to do that by yourself.
We'll be there.
I can't play Flappy Bird.
"What will you order at the restaurant?" "I think some sushi."
Tell them I'm busy.
These three are for you.
It depends.
Tom quickly opened the letter.
He couldn't understand the sentence.
Tell them we're busy.
I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.
I wonder if he loves me.
We live in the United States.
Are you satisfied?
I'm teaching French.
There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.
How many did you want?
I was very tired when I got home last night.
I'll kill him.
Do you speak French every day?
I told it to my friends.
I'm pretty strict, I think.
Can you stay with Tom?
I can't believe three years has already gone by.
Nobody bought it.
I'm a student.
I guess you're better than Tom.
Let me make my position clear.
Stop immediately.

The lion is the king of beasts.
Please tell them to leave.
Tell me the good news first.

The train is made up of fifteen cars.
This is the kind of music I like to listen to.
I'll be hungry.
What'll you eat today?
Are you shy?
What happened to Tom this morning?
Boycott Facebook.
How are you doing?
They were hungry.
I intend to speak more than 20 languages by 2015.
He gave us not only clothes but some money.
Tom decided to go to Australia.
We're neighbors.
We can't wait for you.
I'm not certain.

I'll never forget you.
You are welcome, Jack!

Did anybody come?
You're better than him.
Tom dyed his hair green.

The birds are singing.
Are you ready?

I like to work with Tom.
I'll be with you in a moment.
He has his faults, but I still like him.
Tom said he'll go to Boston in October.
He not only speaks English, he speaks French, too.
We met at the school.
Beginning now, we will speak only French.
I read a book.
Do you want to tell them?
Where was Tom last Monday?
See what I did!
Do you remember borrowing Tom's book?
I need a new pair of shoes.
I'll trust you.
Let us go.
It's been snowing.
It isn't mine.
I can protect you.
I want a green one.
You'll be happy.
When Tom comes, I'll pay the money that I promised.
Tom hanged himself.
Give me all of your money.
You are very brave.
Tom gave me a French dictionary.
Nice suit.
I think I hear them.
What is going on?
I am rich.
He was English.
Tom is naked from the waist up.
I think we have to tell them.
Take this aspirin.
Do you want me to tell them?
Find Tom.
Could you teach me your language?

The wine was excellent.
We're the problem.
Draw a line here.
We all want prices to decline.
Let's not swim.

Are you students?
What's your favorite vegetable?
I like the view.

I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I look on her as my sister.
I'd like to meet Tom sometime.
Hope to see you again next year.
Tell them I'm busy.
Tom lost his car key.
He needs an interpreter.
I'm freezing.
We need you here.
Describe him.
Tom will probably have a heart attack if he doesn't slow down.
Why are you doing this now?
Why did you paint the bench red?
I want Tom.
The roof of the church needs repairs.
Today i'm going home.
This is a game for four players.
She's smarter than him.
I don't like the way people talk about you.
Tom is good at practically everything he does.
I took a walk.
You won.
I know several Canadians.
I felt nervous with so many people watching me.
She's teaching us French.
I'm curious.
It's a wonderful day for a picnic.
Tom says that he's hungry.
None of them speak French.
Warn Tom.
Tell her we don't want to go.
What colour is this cat?
If you're wrong, admit it. If you're right, be quiet.
Tom didn't tell me about you.
Tom doesn't know French.
Did you shoot them?
This tea is good.
Where is your wife?
She dreamed about kissing him.
We can't live without oxygen.
She knows me.

I'll take a steak.
They want to become rich.
I'm going home early today.

How are your folks?
Let's get down to business.

Why don't you help me?
Tom had nothing to eat yesterday.
Speaking.
I'm killing time.
Tell me this isn't true.
Don't ask him who he is.
