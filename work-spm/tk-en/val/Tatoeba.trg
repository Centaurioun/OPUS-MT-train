How are you?
Maybe Mary doesn't know she shouldn't do that.
Sami drove everyone home.
Hello!
I read a book.
She was reading a gardening manual.
I'd like to speak with Tom alone.
Tom is six feet tall.
I want to cry.
I've been to Boston twice and Chicago once.
I don't really think that Tom did that.
Something always goes wrong.
Don't let anyone open the windows.
I don't think that that'll fly.
Find Mary and tell her to come here right away.
I didn't think I'd get fired.
You had better not see her now.
Sami hasn't eaten enough.
Tom said he hopes to keep working here for several more years.
That's my favorite French word.
Of course not.
He died in prison.
Mary found what she was looking for under the table.
Tom is truly a fascinating person.
Let's put up the Christmas tree here.
Tom certainly didn't vote for her.
Gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies . . . or forget to say thank you . . . or pull anybody's hair.
She's pretty, but dangerous.
We played all together.
Be serious about studying, or you'll fail the exam.
Tom isn't going to let that happen.
She's a second grader.
It's too fast.
Wasn't your name on the list?
The washing machine is broken.
I can't approve your plan.
This country is rich in coal.
I saw you staring at Tom.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
Sami bought an expensive car.
Almost.
They said they didn't want to retire.
Did you have a cold last week?
Mary thinks she's infallible.
Tom says he has actually seen a ghost.
I heard that song before.
Tom and Mary are better than you.
I could have helped.
I'm not even capable of pinpointing Germany on a map! I'm ashamed!
Why don't you remember?
This will affect Sami for the rest of his life.
He is good to me.
I doubt that we'll be able to prove that.
He knows that you know that.
Thank you for waiting.
He said that he could help us.
Too late.
Sami's manager came over and started to yell at him.
Boston is where I want to live.
Who?
I looked around the room, but didn't see Tom.
Of course this is my real family name. Here's my passport.
I don't want to read anything else.
I'm Tom's dentist.
He slowly raised the gun.
Why do Tom and Mary hate you?
Where did you hide them?
Mary moved as quickly as she could.
I see her in my dreams often.
Tom isn't much of a talker.
I'm looking forward to going to Australia.
Tom can't come in.
Tom wanted to remind Mary about the meeting.
Tom searched for a job online.
He was unable to hide his tears.
Tom needs to relax.
You've never studied French, have you?
I hope I don't start crying.
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow.
I heard Tom walking up the steps.
"I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday," said Anne.
She admitted that she was lazy.
Nonsense!
Sami is really sick.
Everyone watched them carefully.
The cat is not human.
One of the keys to happiness is to do what you enjoy doing.
Since early childhood, he dreamed of writing stories.
Tom and Mary are exactly where they need to be.
We didn't buy the apartment very long ago.
Tom plays the piano better than me.
I gave Tom all the money that I had.
He shaved his beard.
I didn't think doing that would be much fun.
It belongs to me.
Tom says that he'll study French with Mary this evening.
All books may be divided into two classes.
Tom is working in Australia.
Do you often read books that are in French?
A tornado is coming in.
I'm not interested in learning how to cook Thai food.
Tom and Mary are a perfect match.
Tell it to the cops.
Sami didn't sing that song.
I see you haven't much confidence in my ability to make tea.
She never mentioned it again.
Where are my credit cards?
From the tall dune I could see over the whole island.
Welcome.
Tin is a soft metal.
You won't believe what I have found today.
Where's the shovel?
Don't give them any ideas.
The day is short and there is much work.
Do you smell something unusual?
We want to make learning effective, interesting, and fascinating.
Tom has a problem that he needs to solve.
He wrote her a letter.
Do you have a moment, Tom?
Where have you been? I was worried.
It's hard to forget his first love.
Tom always makes fun of me.
Don't worry. These things happen.
Tom cried himself to sleep.
Where did you buy that scarf?
Tom and Mary say they haven't seen John since he and Alice broke up.
She's repairing her bicycle.
We're husband and wife.
Your sorrow is my sorrow.
Speak gently to everyone.
I heard a loud noise.
Does anyone know how Tom will be going to Australia?
Corals are a beautiful and important part of our ocean.
Do you speak Macedonian?
Do you love your mother?
Take our picture.
He returned very late at night.
Tom and Mary are kissing cousins.
He wished he were taller.
Put that down!
You can't buy this medicine without a prescription.
Sami's dog scared Layla's cat.
Do you know how to juggle?
Tom and I are both painters.
I won't take your money.
I don't speak German, but the Germans themselves I love.
I'm going to put on some music.
Play!
How long do frogs live?
Tom and Mary ran to the bus stop, but they still missed the bus.
Why did she ask?
Times are changing, and we are changing with them.
It's very cold here in October.
I bought a new printer.
It is said that she is ill.
That has nothing to do with our business.
She couldn't do what she wanted to.
She sells shoes.
I must do that carefully.
Goodnight!
Fry.
Are you sure it'll be OK?
Please don't do anything else till Tom and Mary get here.
I am too lazy to go there.
Aren't you one of Tom's children?
Halley's Comet will come back in 2061.
Mary had a long and happy life.
I will learn.
Tom ran into the house to get something to drink.
Focus!
What do you feed your cats?
She began to play an old song.
She kicked him.
I've already told Tom that I plan on staying in Australia for three more weeks.
She went to the market once a week.
This door is locked from inside.
You must be prepared for an emergency.
Tom said you need to be careful.
I never should've listened to you.
It's boring to stay at home.
Tom is already getting dressed.
We'll probably go to Australia next year.
He got in his car and drove away.
I thanked Tom and Mary for their advice.
Tom became the head of the company.
I didn't specify exactly what I wanted.
Sami stepped on the dog's tail.
I think I'm going to go inside.
This is my daughter.
Fadil was driving.
To distinguish right from wrong is difficult.
She said that she cried every day.
You're going to start right now.
How much is this biro?
Put the bag down.
What are you going to do when you graduate?
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be jealous.
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow.
I don't know how long the concert will last.
I had to tell the truth.
I've told her all about you.
Being honest is difficult.
I saw Tom in the mirror so I turned around and said hi.
My aunt gave me a photo album.
I'm going to wash my hands.
Shoot!
Tom and Mary sat the kitchen drinking tea and talking about their children.
I can't say.
The only thing Tom does nowadays is watch TV.
What happens if Tom and Mary don't show up?
You need more practice.
Mary tried to hide her feelings.
I never wear a suit.
Mary told me that she's never met you.
Who gave you that envelope?
If you explain it, Tom ought to understand it.
I know that you've been worried about Tom.
I saw Tom with Mary the other night.
He made plans.
His eyes shone like stars.
Tom got awfully sick and had to go home.
Morning!
Manon is not like the other girls.
Mary wasn't able to do what she wanted.
I forgot my suitcase.
My eyes are blue.
Tom barely escaped.
Tom and Mary don't have the ability to finish the job by themselves.
Where do you think Tom and Mary want to live?
Tom was absent from school all last week.
I'll stay here until you return.
Tom worked all day long.
I'm quite certain Tom didn't do that.
He acted like a lunatic.
I want you to listen to me carefully.
I saw Tom's birth certificate.
I won't tell them.
You must open it for them.
I wonder if Tom really wanted to go to Australia with Mary.
I want to know exactly what you did.
I wanted to pay closer attention.
I broke Tom's nose.
Tom and Mary did their best to get the job done by the end of the day.
What is it, dear?
He was watching TV last night.
Fadil used drugs.
Sami was losing thousands of dollars.
Sami didn't even look over there.
Mary couldn't find her left shoe.
We usually talked in English.
It's not that far.
Aren't you free this weekend?
Tom still doesn't have to do that.
We aren't going anywhere in this rain.
Obviously.
He goes to school.
Tokyo has many ancient temples.
I don't think that you need to tell Tom that you're planning to do that.
She wanted me to teach her French.
I will make it clear for him, just in case.
Tom and Mary say that they're too busy to help John today.
I didn't have a good time last Sunday.
I like money.
When did you decide to let Tom do that?
The burglar got away.
Tom is counting money.
Are you going to vote for her?
Tom didn't know that Mary had done that.
Mary confessed that she did that.
Tom and Mary said they wanted to change out of their wet clothes into something dry.
Sami came to the car.
Bye!
They always keep their dog chained up.
The hairdresser cut the guest's hair.
No trees exist higher than the Eiffel Tower.
They smiled at you, didn't they?
I'll sit with him.
I've already told you I didn't do that.
That's why I like Eurovision.
She bought her dream house.
Tom doesn't seem to trust anyone.
My mom really used to like telling anecdotes.
I've been waiting a long time.
Do you know how to use this?
I don't care if Tom does that or not.
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support his family.
Tom works in our Boston office.
I cooked this myself.
Do you speak Albanian?
Tom's career ended almost before it began.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Boston.
It didn't take Tom much time to do that.
Tom bought a hot dog for Mary.
He's very afraid of death.
Tom has a nasty temper.
I want you to stay here until Tom and Mary get here.
I'd love to have breakfast with you.
That goes against my beliefs.
I dream of a society whose wealth is distributed fairly.
You're the only one who needs to do that.
I am boring.
Tom died during the sweltering heat of August in Atlantic City.
The word is repeatedly used with that meaning.
I was blinded by the bright sun.
I don't know anybody I can practice speaking French with.
I don't want to go to school.
John looks at the roses.
Change into some old clothes before you clean the garage.
Tom is respected by all of us.
I didn't really think Tom could do that.
It's always cold in here.
He doesn't take care of his health.
I saw Tom kissing John's wife.
She can't speak English, much less French.
Mary has sold her house in Australia.
There's a lot of wind this morning, isn't there?
It's quite clear that Tom doesn't want to be here.
I laughed.
Tom must have been the first one to do that.
I can't do that tonight.
Help!
You promised that there would be plenty of hedgehogs in the village!
Tom came here today looking to start a fight.
Tom went out drinking almost every night when he was in Boston.
Will you be going?
Do you have the book?
I doubt that I'll be successful this time.
I'm sure that Tom and John are very busy men.
Do you have a moment to talk about Tom?
Please wait while I get you a towel.
I want you to keep away from her.
Sami talked about that in a separate video.
Hungry?
There's a bus stop neighbouring our school.
I know you.
She cannot find her bonnet.
Japanese parents are not keen to talk about their own children.
The price is reasonable.
She has lost her hearing.
Everything is under the table.
I've seen a lot of changes here.
Vultures circled over the dead bodies.
They asked for their money back.
It's on top.
Mary knew that she had to escape.
This is a secret.
Honestly...
I know that you don't believe me.
You tried.
I know Tom lied.
Can you tell him something good about me?
People say I mumble.
He'll need to do that by himself.
Tom will come back and kill us.
I didn't count on anything else.
Isn't that a friend of yours?
He said that he would not sell the garden.
I was talking about him.
If Tom wants to go, he can.
I don't want to be here any more than you.
Tom's hands are tied.
You don't have to sit with Tom.
I bought the TV from her.
The fire is fully extinguished.
Chest out!
I will tie a rope round your waist, so that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.
I know that Tom has lived in Australia.
Sami brushed his teeth.
They cried when their dogs died.
I lied about it.
Tom was jealous of me.
Tom and Mary aren't very hungry.
Three people are missing.
Please be more patient.
I'll be with you every step of the way.
Tom couldn't do that by himself.
Sami was tracking Layla on Facebook.
Where did you buy that pen?
How did you get that box opened?
I didn't have enough time to do everything that had to be done.
Tom said that he didn't know anyone who could fly a helicopter.
Tom's native language is French.
Tom will not do it.
Look!
Man's life is short.
She has plenty of friends.
Never mind!
Tom beat me at chess.
I wanted to become a doctor.
It's snowing where Tom and Mary are.
We're going to come again.
Tom picked out a book to read.
Could you check to see if the garage door is closed?
The group left early in 1791.
It's the same hat.
I have nothing to do now.
Tom is peeling the potatoes, isn't he?
This is my mother.
Tom talks about Mary all the time.
Somebody stole my car.
I've been waiting for this moment for years.
I saw what was happening.
Last night, I didn't sleep.
Do you believe in afterlife?
I have a dream.
We warned you.
Do you have paper?
Tom kissed Mary softly on the lips.
His troubles are not over.
Tom asked his friend for advice.
Tom is a born leader.
You should not be afraid of the future.
How could you understand what I'm feeling?
He spreads gossip.
"Well, there's something I'd like your advice on about my research project ..." "Let's see... Hmm, you're investigating flowering plants then."
You've got ten minutes to pack your bags.
Tom is really jealous and he gets mad when other guys talk to me.
There's someone inside.
I told you not to worry.
Tom didn't seem very satisfied.
You don't eat anything.
Tom is pretty bad at French, isn't he?
Why are we poor?
Tom and Mary say they have a lot to do today.
They have a very spacious dining room.
Tom told me he didn't know Mary very well.
I don't like my wife to call me at work.
I saw you crying.
You'll do great.
Our government doesn't care about us.
Are you listening?
Tom didn't ask anything.
I don't remember how I got home last night.
Tom had to wait.
The whole world hungers for peace.
The meeting will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Mary was polite and smiled.
It's 2:30 by my watch.
Someone hit me on the back.
Do Tom and Mary know how much you paid for this?
How can I gain her trust?
You're famous now.
My father studies astronomy, or the science of stars.
Well, never mind. This day's done and there's a new one coming tomorrow, with no mistakes in it yet, as you used to say yourself.
Don't you worry about them.
It began to rain cats and dogs.
Mary lent all the money she had on her to me.
Tom had problems at school.
No one could make the princess laugh.
Tom is going to ask Mary to do that for John.
The heat was unbearable.
Sami doesn't like this.
Do you have a match?
What didn't they get?
Happy New Year!
How did you find out about us?
I don't think you should drink that water.
I have to get rid of all this stuff.
You haven't yet convinced Tom to do that, have you?
You can't come tomorrow.
I don't want to read anything else.
I don't want to eat.
Lack of sleep can have an enormous negative impact on a student's grades.
Did Tom speak French to you?
Sami's house was in ruins.
What is wrong with you?
Tom came here to use my computer.
Did he write anything in his diary yesterday?
Tom and Mary haven't yet sold their house.
Tom tried his best to calm Mary down.
Mary began putting on her shoes.
Absolutely!
Sami felt terrible.
The roses were from Sami.
What sound does a mouse make?
All you have to do is to push this button.
Tom is a talkative person.
"The Jucklins" is an 1896 novel by Opie Read. It was a bestseller at that time.
I don't like the color of these shoes.
Are you still waiting for Tom?
I moved to Australia last winter.
There are a lot of breweries in Bavaria.
Listen...
She waited for her lover at the station.
I want to drink tea.
Sami goes to church on Wednesday.
You never believed me.
I'll warn Tom.
How did you open that box?
I've done more work on my farm in the last three months than you've done in three years.
You must be pretty rich.
I say go for it.
Did you write anything in your diary yesterday?
I have a good mind to study abroad.
Oh! Show me, please.
Sami really liked that color.
Mary is still your girlfriend, isn't she?
Is it OK if I come?
You want to be finished doing that by 2:30, don't you?
Sami doesn't wear jeans.
Do you want a job?
This is something I made.
I thought I would be able to do that.
Long suffering!
I want to know exactly what you did.
It's uncertain if Tom will come.
They cook their own meals.
Translate this text.
A woman is the most sweet thing in the world.
I'm going to fetch some milk.
Tom and Mary will agree on that.
I baked Tom some cookies.
This is the camera he took the picture with.
I can't remember.
Good to see you!
We have better weather today.

They told me that they were very happy.
Yesterday was your birthday, wasn't it?

As long as you have hope, a chance remains.

Tom and Mary said they'll try to buy everything we need.
Tom likes to hear himself talk.

Is that blue?
They said that they'd never teach French.
The answer Tom gave seemed wrong to me.
Tom was helping the poor.
The world could use a lot more people like him.
Tom and Mary used the money John gave them to buy something to eat.
You may as well begin at once.
I stayed home this summer.
You're not the only one who cares about Tom.
I saw you look at it.
Tom said he loved Mary and would always love her.
What kept you up all night?
Do you really have to go now?

Tender kisses.
My mom always says that she will visit me soon.
Tom left the office at 2:30.

I'm dying for a cup of coffee.
I saw Tom in there.
Is Mary's husband a general?
The jewel was stolen during the night.
I think that Tom is going to be OK.
I have to go get her.
We probably don't have enough time to finish doing this today.
I have met him before.
You look much better.
I like your apartment a lot.
I know I can always count on you.
Nobody saw them leave the room.
Can you open the door, please?
Thanks.
You didn't recognize me?
I thought that you didn't know how to play the banjo.
Maybe Mary doesn't know she shouldn't do that.
What kept you up all night?
Tom didn't seem to agree with us.
I want to see you later.
How awful!
I am a housewife.
Tom said that he didn't intend to do that anymore.
I'm calling to see if you'd be interested in going to Boston with me next week.
I'm more than a friend.
I don't want to attract attention.
Straighten your legs.
Why don't you let Tom know you aren't going to do that?
Where are the books?
I don't have a present for Tom yet.
"Whose ears are these?" "They are Mickey Mouse's."
Sami isn't there.
This book contains a lot of beautiful illustrations.
Tom's married.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
You know that I love all three of you.
Tom and Mary promised that they'd do that, but they didn't.
I hope that Mary likes the present I bought for her.
There's actually plenty to do in Australia.
I live near Boston.
I haven't even told Tom.
Do you think that Tom knows what happened?
Tom never wanted to do anything we asked him to do.
Aren't you glad we didn't do that today?
Full speed ahead!
Buy!
Tom spent a lot of time checking his homework.
I thought Tom wouldn't recognize Mary.
She went to America for the purpose of studying English literature.
You'll do that for Tom, won't you?
Sami found that so weird.
I didn't think there was any reason why we needed to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't do it properly.
He helped you, didn't he?
Maryland is the richest state in the United States.
We should probably postpone the competition.
I used to go to school with him.
I will try.

We will not do it.
Listen as much as you want.

Tom might've caught something.
They say that they're prepared to do that.
Tom often drives too fast.
You were sitting in front of the glass with beer.

You're gonna make me furious!
He looked like he was asleep.

Return that book when you have read it, please.
No, thanks.

Mary turned everyone's head.
Tom and Mary said they don't eat meat anymore.
Tom needs some therapy.
Be true to yourself.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
Tom is likely to be suspicious.
I wonder if Tom is confused.
I know precisely how Tom feels.
What would you do in my place?
Sami wasted a lot of time.
I know the reason why Tom and Mary haven't done that.
Halloween was brought to North America by immigrants from Europe who would celebrate the harvest around a bonfire, share ghost stories, sing, and tell fortunes.
Do you have time to help me?
I know you.
Sami could use his shoe laces to hang himself.

Can't anyone else come?
How did Mary know we were looking for her?
I saw Tom smoking a cigarette.
Tom is going to need more time.
Why does Tom want to be a carpenter?
I think doing that would help.
Maybe it's Fadil.
Thanking you in anticipation.
We are happy together.
Shouting isn't singing.
He'd be fired if he didn't do that.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be impartial.
You wouldn't have been so busy if Tom had helped.
They're fishers.
She taught her children French.
Can you please tell me what's happening?
Things that you see with your eyes are not necessarily true.
Tell Mary she can't go.
Walk slowly.
Tom and Mary say they don't want to talk to you.
Tom didn't tell me that he didn't have a driver's license.
Tom and Mary promised me that they'd come.
Tom said that's not good enough.
Sami was in the conference room.
Tom needs to do that before he leaves.
I think I'm going to go inside.
Tom wasn't the one who told me you wanted to do that.
The whole world was involved in the war.
Wow!
If you see Tom and Mary, please tell them I'm looking for them.
He is bored.
My back has been acting up again.
Faster!
We are writing an email for our friends.
One minute earlier, and they could have caught the bus.
What motivated these kids?
Fool!
The swimming pool will be closed tomorrow.
I have found your dirty little secret.
Sami brought me here to embarrass me.
Sami will call that number.
Don't you think it's wrong to cheat on an examination?
It would be worth trying.
Tom waited his turn.
Don't tell that to my wife.
I know why Tom and Mary were crying.
You're a lot smarter than you think.
Why don't you sit down? The seat is vacant.
Is everything arranged for tomorrow?
It's nice and warm.
Sami stole tires.
You've seen what Tom can do.
This is a book about England.
Telephone!
Do we have enough food for everyone?
They could've gone by themselves.
Tom and Mary kept their heads above water.
If you'd been there, we would've had a good time together.
One of the keys to happiness is to do what you enjoy doing.
Tom loves talking about sports.
He eventually changed his mind.
A man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him.
I haven't seen Karen since we fell out last month.
Can you really blame him?
It'll make Tom very happy.
Louder.
I won't come if you invite them.
This is a secret.
Tom and Mary can speak French almost as well as they can speak English.
Tom is the tallest in the class.
Do you think Tom and Mary are too aggressive?
Hi, I'm the King of the Universe.
I'm hoping for a really big discount.
Tom spent time in Australia.
I ran as fast as I could in order to reach her.
Mary shook her head and smiled.
Those are exactly what we want.
Tom couldn't stop the tears.
She's taller than her mother.
This is the first time I've hugged Mary.
I really want you to meet them.
Yes, sometimes.
Mary made this bookcase by herself.
It was very considerate of you to do that for Tom.
I wish Tom and Mary were on our team.
Tom said that he studied French.
Each of the girls was dressed neatly.
Look at what we did.
Tom got here a half an hour after Mary did.
Where did you meet them?
Did you hear what he said?
Sami didn't stop filming.
This is my desk.
Tom keeps on asking me for money.
He shared his entire life story with me.
What was Tom complaining about?
Have you heard how fast he talks?
Monday morning I was bitten by a dog.
Health begins with good sleep.
Someone's knocking at the door.
I haven't got books.
At attention!
Certainly.
I don't want to look like a tourist.
Tom and Mary looked around, but they couldn't see anything.
In autumn, leaves fall off trees.
When an earthquake occurs, what will you do first?
Tom and Mary shouldn't have stayed here by themselves.
She waited.
How would you react if your wife told you that?
We're running late.
Susan's clothes are dirty.
She lost her way in the forest.
We didn't know who had done this.
Will you drive me home?
He is a mean fellow.
Sell!
He rewrote it.
Did you truly believe Sami was a vampire?
I'm pretty full.
Japan won't stop surprising us.
It gets quite hot here in the summer.
I found myself a friend.
Thank you so much for dinner.
You've got food on your face.
Show us where you found Tom.
I'm one of Tom's teammates.
This article is nonsense.
You recovered quickly.
I don't think this is the only way to do this.
The pen is the tongue of the soul.
He looked like he was sleepy.
Do you want coffee?
Mary never talks about what she does at work.
Do you think it would be better to write Tom a letter?
Shit.
I got up quickly.
Do you believe that God exists?
Why haven't you told us?
I will try.
Sami bought shampoo for his dog.
We've found Tom.
Tom didn't know Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
I am not a doctor.
You still haven't met your girlfriends parents?
Tom told Mary he'd be ready to go in three minutes.
I just bought a house.
This morning's meeting was shorter than usual.
You can't come in.
I can't come over tonight.
No one could make the princess laugh.
I think Tom didn't believe me.
Did I mention that he's handsome?
I don't like to be corrected in public.
The burglar got away.
Why weren't you able to sleep last night?
Enough!
I bought the car at a 10% discount.
I would like to change my job. I am not satisfied either with my salary or working conditions.
Sami worked from ten to two.
Tom is unbeatable.
Tom is reading a book in his room.
Tom still hasn't returned.
You can take anything you want.
The flowers in the garden need water.
Hand me the water carafe.
Hi.
They say they've been asked to stay.
I got one.
Yesterday I went to the Goethe-Institut in Bologna with my mother to ask for information about their German courses.
Probably.
Sami is studying.
Mary's parents told her that playing with fire was dangerous.
Can you please tell me how deep this lake is?
It was my first kiss.
I think people should stop using disposable shopping bags.
Mary thinks she's infallible.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
Sami built up the courage to tell Layla about that.
Sami is being ridiculous.
You won't be able to do anything about that now.
All were present.
Mary told everybody she was scared.
Tom said that he was going to allow us to do that.
Layla sleeps with a butcher knife under her pillow.
You're too lazy.
I think that I need glasses.
She's teaching students English.
Tom is somewhere in Australia.
I hope you'll return.
I depend on nobody.
You're still taller than me.
Tom survived the attack.
I'll be here waiting for you at 2:30.
We do not fix computers here.
Speak gently to everyone.
I'm going to Australia on Monday.
Come downstairs and have your supper.
Fine!
I ran as fast as I could in order to reach her.
I don't have any chains for my car.
The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.
Play!
I think everybody should learn another language.
Tom covered the table with the new tablecloth he'd just bought.
Show us where you found Tom.
The world could use a lot more people like her.
I think Tom and Mary will eventually give up and ask John to do that for them.
Tom said that he felt disappointed.
I didn't think you were going to have to do that again.
That's the way I would've done that.
You're gonna make me furious!
I should probably not tell Tom that I'm hungry.
I didn't want to tell you about this on the phone.
Put that down!
I think you're quite right.
Tom appeared on the steps.
I don't want to wake the kids up.
In the end, we obtained what we wanted.
Let me hear your frank opinion.
I had some interesting experiences while I was traveling.
Tom locked both doors and all of the windows.
What would I do without you?
I don't want any more to eat.
This is a really cushy job. Mostly I just sit around drinking tea.
Tom and Mary are in their seats.
My uncle gave me some good advice when I was in trouble.
Tom is a believer.
That could take years.
Absolutely!
Action!
Dogs and cats aren't friends.
She told me that she'd love to help.
There's a telephone in the hall.
I'm sorry, I do not understand. Can you repeat it a little slower?
Just as I thought.
We're sorry about the bad weather.
I've been working here for many decades.
I don't think this is the wrong road.
Mary kept on working even though she was sick.
You know this isn't fair.
Quickly!
I see no other course of action.
It's okay, Tom. It's only me.
The person who's helping Tom is Mary.
I'm your new neighbor.
I had a lot on my mind, so I wasn't really listening to what Tom was saying.
Mary knew me.
You took risks, didn't you?
We took risks.
Don't you want to know what Tom looks like?
Tom said that he might never come back.
Tom isn't in charge.
Sami just wanted to talk.
Now I'm free.
See below.
Make it right now.
I love you like crazy.
Many people lost their homes after the earthquake.
Sami got sick and died.
I must get in.
It's not yet time.
Sami and Layla's honeymoon is over.
I think I do need some glasses.
What kept you up all night?
Life itself is your teacher, and you are in a state of constant learning.
I don't want to teach French.
Tom criticized Mary in front of everyone.
Do you really want to wait till Tom and Mary show up?
You aren't looking.
Walk!
I asked her to wait, but she left.
They are talking to each other.
You're frightening the guests.
Tom was told by his doctor to remain in bed.
Mary says she doesn't want to talk about that.
I wish I knew.
Tom said that Mary shouldn't tell John about what happened.
They finished their homework.
