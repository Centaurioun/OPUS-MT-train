She opened her eyes again.
Have you asked him for help?
Tom is going to be happy to see you again.
Sami is reading Layla's diary.
My thirteen-year-old daughter is going on her first date tomorrow.
The heat was unbearable.
I don't know what my real passion is.
I won't let you do it.
I have to explain this to him.
I think it might not be safe to cross this bridge.
I'm very tired. I don't want to do this now.
We've already decided not to leave early.
Mary makes her own bread.
Tom and Mary aren't so old, are they?
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be at home.
Tom came into the room without knocking on the door.
Layla's hair was down to her belly button.
He said he wants to sell his house.
I saw Tom's father.
I'm sure.
Hurray!
There's no way Tom did that.
I can't sleep if the lights are on.
Why should Tom go to Australia?
I think Tom will permit us to do that.
Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
The population of Japan is less than America.
I'm sorry, I do not understand. Can you repeat it a little slower?
I wasn't expecting guests.
Tom has curly hair just like his father.
Hey, sist!
Do you know where my key is?
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.
How could Tom not like me?
He has to speak French for his job.
We'll make you happy.
Please wash your hands properly before eating.
I know Tom isn't much taller than me.
Give me a piece.
She got up at seven in the morning.
I've got a toothache. I just can't bear this pain anymore.
Mary walked in and quietly closed the door behind her.

What we know is that Fadil sometimes beat Layla.
I never should've listened to you.
It was not until the baby was fed that he stopped crying.
Sami and his mom didn't speak to each other for six weeks.
The eagle flew away.
I don't think that Tom knows that I hate him.
I think Tom wouldn't be lonely if Mary were here.
We're not taking questions.
Sami nearly lost his home.
I saw Tom three hours ago.
Did you just call me old?
To distinguish right from wrong is difficult.
Move out of my way.
She has been told she can't do that.
You made the same mistake as last time.
He wanted me to help him today.
I knew Tom wasn't ready to leave.
Dunno.
Who are Tom and Mary going to listen to?
I've admired you for many years.
I suspect that Tom doesn't want to do that today.
Tom couldn't think of anything else to try.
I want to study Turkmen.
I promised Tom I'd go shopping with him.
I would've gone to Australia with you if my parents had let me.
Goodbye!
I saw Tom's picture.
I won't go out until it stops raining.
I'm not old.
They said they're planning to do that.
Aren't you going to sit with Tom?
Great!
They clapped their hands together.
You cannot expect much of him.
Do you guys know each other?
Why me?
I've lived in Kobe before.
Tom is three years older than you.
Sami had met Layla before.
He is afraid.
Actually, I'm not suggesting anything.
She had him wrapped around her little finger.
I don't think Tom knows everybody's name yet.
I feel dizzy every time I get up.
How did you find out about us?
A variety of people gathered at the meeting.
Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.
Welcome home.
Tom gave Mary a pedicure.
I eat oatmeal every day.
Do you love your mother?
What can I do to help them?
Would you lend me your pen for a minute?
I don't want to go, but I have to.
They have a very spacious dining room.
I must get in.
He's proud of his work.
I gave Tom a small wave.
Tom became a minister.
She will be jealous.
On Sundays I don't always remain at home.
I'll give up math.
Sami killed a leopard.
He said that he was very angry.
Look forward.
I thought that you might like something to drink.
Thanks for what you did yesterday.
Why did you let Tom and Mary do that?
Tom came to my rescue.
Didn't you recognize me?
I will come.
Tom has a problem, and he wants to solve it.
I didn't think Tom would tell you how to do that.
It's clear that Tom and Mary don't want to be here.
I have a chill.
Please keep your voices down.
Tom never said one word.
Are you listening to me?
Tom said he didn't mind.
Look above that building.
I wasn't with Tom.
Tom's reply didn't surprise anyone.
I thought Tom wouldn't recognize Mary.
She washes her car once a week.
Show us some results.
She's cooking now.
I came home empty handed.
Tom is going to join us shortly.
Tom came here to ask us to help him.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Literature is a nation's future.
Suddenly, the door closed with a loud noise.

Tom is going to visit me tonight.
Nail polish remover stinks a lot.
Tom hurt his leg while playing football.
He wished he had more free time.
Tom really dislikes children.
Mary is almost never home, is she?
Tom doesn't know who can sing well and who can't.
Mary is a university student, isn't she?
Do you have time to help me?
Exactly!
Tom opened the oven door.
This fish is good.
I ran into a little trouble.
Do you sell advance tickets here?
Tom thought his parents were perfect.
Read!
He said that he disagrees.
Tom is so happy.
Tom doesn't have to tell Mary how to do that.
I'm angry.
What're Tom and Mary planning to do after they graduate from college?
Tom said you have to be careful.
I have a piano.
They drink too much.
I am a student.
We were fascinated by her voice.
He told me he wasn't ready to go.
You sell shoes.
Sami didn't even order a dress.
Let me tell you what needs to be done.
Welcome.
We met in front of the school.
It is not easy to distinguish good from evil.
Ben and I don't get along. We have nothing in common.
He told me he wasn't sick anymore.
Wrong.
We'll show them who we are.
Tell us a little about your family.
You promised that there would be plenty of hedgehogs in the village!
She cut her finger.
You agreed to let Tom and Mary do that.
Tom thought that he'd found the perfect hiding place.
I put cream in my coffee.
You sell shoes, don't you?
This is a tough one.
Tom had never been to Australia.
I always take a bath before going to bed.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary was so angry.
I could barely breathe.
Drive.
A chauffeur sat in front.
Tom went to visit his sister in Boston.
The painting he'd painted wasn't very good so nobody praised it.
I hope you change your mind.
You seem confident.
I'm getting used to this new machine.
I'm sure we'll be able to manage that.
Mary hadn't been expecting that answer.
When was the last time you used a ruler?
I don't know how to eat sushi with chopsticks.
My uncle is angry.
I think that Tom didn't need to leave so early.
Stay away from the dangerous neighborhoods.
This is a story written in easy English.
I just bought myself a new jacket.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
Tom and Mary wouldn't have let their own children do that.
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
I wonder whether Tom is really going deaf.
I wish I knew more than one language.
Did you buy a car?
We are writing an email for our friends.
We won't need money.
Now he has nothing to live for.
Mary is always late, isn't she?
I forgot to feed the fish.
I go to school on a bus.
Cool!
Tom, you should come, too.
What kept you up all night?
Work.
Tom is from Australia and Mary is from New Zealand.
Speaking.
The magician made the young lady float into the air.
I wasn't very hungry, so I didn't eat much.
Tom is still not ready to go, is he?
I didn't know Tom would be absent.
We know you're working for them.
I saw Tom last weekend at the club.
Using Excel is not easy.

She may leave anytime she wants to.
Mary told Tom about her problems.
Tom and Mary say they don't like Boston.
The man you saw yesterday was my uncle.
He couldn't resist.
Why is Tom sad?
Is she beautiful?
Sorry! I'm not good at explaining.
Mary rewrote it.
Sami dated Layla's little sister.
Are your grandchildren here in Australia?
It's true that Tom is in Australia.
They're studying in their rooms.
Where are you?
Susan greeted her guests at the door.
Understood.
I kept on singing.
Where did he stay last night?
I'm just a guy asking questions.
Mary left her umbrella on the bus.
Tom sold a pint of his blood for thirteen dollars.
She's painting her nails.
I don't think Tom was disappointed with the results.
Sami has lost his job.
I know that you don't believe me.
I am not married.
It's a quarter after six right now.
You should've followed Tom's orders.
We hope that you don't do that again.
If I were a bird, I could fly to you.
My mom is the best mom in the world!
There are security cameras all around here.
Tom came home from Australia last week.
I thought maybe you wouldn't want to do that.
I don't even want to be here now.
Mary says she does that.
You should get back home the day after tomorrow.
I like much money.
Sami's dad has passed away.
He was such a materialistic person.
You should have locked, or at least closed, all the doors.
His ability in mathematics is outstanding.
You've got ten minutes to pack your bags.
Protons and electrons are fundamental components of atoms.
I want to live.
Tom is trying to do that, isn't he?

What did you say?
Tom is three years older than you.
Turn off the fan when you're done reading the book.
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow.
Can I borrow one for about two weeks?
Tom says Mary doesn't like Australia.
The world could use a lot more people like her.
Why did Tom need to go to Australia?
That's why he did it.
I cannot express my gratitude with words.
Sami lives on the second floor.
We should do away with this regulation.
Yes, of course.
Tom is sitting on the desk.
He said that he was rich.
What exactly did you tell Tom?
You may impress me, but you'll never impress Tom.
I wonder what effect technical advances such as the Internet, mobile phones and digitalization technology have on the people's awareness, actions and interest in politics.
Careful!
She has to stop smoking.
Regrettably!
Do you think you're smarter than Tom?
Probably.
What time do you usually go home?
I usually buy clothing at a local store.
I should have done that earlier.
Do you often buy lottery tickets?
She said that she wasn't alone.
I wish that more people could be like you.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in Australia?
I've been working here for many decades.
Tom doesn't think Mary is nervous.
I am a volunteer.
Malbrough is going to war.
Watch.
He met his stepsister for the first time today.
Tom is refusing to do that.
Do you like ravioli?
Tom can't tell the difference between promise and forecast.
Those are my cats.
Bye.
You have to speak French here.
Do what you consider needed.
Did Tom get there in time?
I don't understand.
I saw you and Tom kissing.
Sami was so skinny.
Tom and Mary look like they're tempted to do that.
Are you going to vote for her?
Are you certain Tom will do that?
You don't have to answer any of Tom's questions if you don't want to.
Aren't you going out tonight?
The brain serves many people who have no power, but power serves many people who have no brains.
That's why I like Eurovision.
Does Tom always sneeze this much in the spring?
Better late than never.
"I like teaching, too," said Gilbert.
He devoted himself to music in those days.
I thought that Tom would stop by to say hello.
I didn't buy that.
Tom didn't tell me what the meeting was going to be about.
I'll probably do exactly the same thing Tom does.
Bye-bye!
His books are interesting.
Tom complained that Mary never helped him.
I need to do that sometime today.
I'll miss my teammates.
Mary is good at this game, isn't she?
Okay.
Tom wants to go and see his father.
He admitted he wasn't really rich.
He misses Boston.
He can't chew well, because he has a toothache now.
Absolutely!
What beautiful weather!
The kid is drinking the milk.
Sami didn't understand that.
They're still alive.
I want to thank you for picking Tom up after school.
I am fed up.
Suicide is a crime in some parts of the world.
I have not yet read the book you are talking about.
It happened over a year ago.
I know someone who might be able to help.
Nature never breaks its own laws.
What fun we had yesterday!
Two dogs guard the entrance.
Enjoy!
How much is he paying you?
And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.
I have a dictionary.
I have grapes.
I know precisely how Tom feels.
Do you really think we can help?
I think it's unlikely Tom will ask Mary to do that.
Sami was in his bedroom.
I can't even find time to read.
They said that they felt better.
Tell the story again.
Please close the fridge.
Mary said she wasn't from Boston.
I think that was her.
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Tom was doing drugs.
I wish you would use yourself to translate, every day, only three or four lines, from any book, in any language, into the correctest and most elegant English that you can think of; you cannot imagine how it will insensibly form your style, and give you an habitual elegancy: it would not take you up a quarter of an hour in a day.
Let me tie your shoes for you.
I don't know where my umbrella is.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Pierre, please.
I knew Tom might not be able to do that.
I was angry.
They're warming themselves by the fire.
You must give it to her.
He tried to kill himself yesterday.
Sami would always do little shit like that.
The police arrested us.
Is there anything you want to say?
I'm just starving.
It was nice to meet you.
I don't think that Tom was satisfied.
I should sleep for three months at least.
I want this luggage taken to my room at once.
Drive!
I'm in a great mood today.
We need to eat something.
Don't stand up.
I was unsure what to expect.
Whose friend is he?
I usually sleep with my windows open in the summer.
We haven't tried doing that yet.
Pay attention to the bikes.
What is the capital of Turkmenistan?
They say that they're good at French.
Sami took care of the property.
I think you should go now.
I agreed.
I'm hoping it's only a temporary problem.
You'll start right now.
Sami is going home now.
Tom doesn't have to tell Mary how to do that.
I was very hungry by lunchtime.
We made sure of it.
I know the father of this girl.
You can make your choice freely without fear of retribution.
All is over.
Is that the real reason that you don't like Tom?
Wait.
Turtles don't have teeth.
I swear I won't leave you alone.
We need to work now.
During the night it's very cold.
Tom listened to an audiobook .

I know where to find him.
We're just being cautious.

I think that Tom is miserable.
My sister washes her hair every morning.
He didn't understand me.
Could you go get some wood for the fire?
I like going by train.
Tom and Mary played with their cats.
People should mind their own business first and foremost.
We kiss our child a hundred times a day.
Tom and Mary are worried that something might happen to them.
The weather was beautiful.
Do you have a moment to talk about Tom?
A lot of crimes are not reported.

No one knew what to do.
You were cutting the bread.
Tom lives a quiet life.
You don't know how happy I am that you've found a new friend.
Tom asked Mary to go with John.
Do you speak Albanian?
That bird is called wagtail.
Sami bought Layla a gift.
I overslept.
What time does the train for Milan leave?
What is this?
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
Tom thinks that if he had done that earlier, he could've avoided a lot of problems.
Mary told me she'd do that, too.
Tom went to the office.
I will try.
This should work.
Tom didn't know where his car key was.

Tom is out riding his bicycle.
I've never actually met them.
Sami is gonna have nothing.
Tom wasn't very patient.
I think she is the kindest woman on earth.
Ready!
Where did he get that much money?
Stop!
I'm pretty sure that Tom is in love with Mary.
Stop being stupid.
Bring me lemon tea, please.
Aren't you ever going to tell me how you did that?
Perfect!
I haven't yet done what Tom said I needed to do.
The cat is in its basket.
You should keep in touch with Tom.
Tom didn't seem as busy as Mary.
Tom and Mary asked John many times to let them go home early, but he wouldn't let them.
I owed Tom nothing.
I'm the one who made this.
From this point on, the story becomes so twisted and grotesque that I can't stop reading it anymore.
I cannot say.

Tom and Mary dipped their toes into the water.
Have you ever been in Okinawa?

That's very vague.
Mary took risks.
Oh well. That's no big deal.
We actually did that.
It was unbearably hot.
You can do that yourselves.
She cannot be accepted.
It may take many years.
She speaks English very well.
Peace and love.

Tom is probably in Boston.

We did warn her.
I can't communicate with Tom like I used to.
Tom and Mary don't want to study music.
Who are you calling stupid?
Her computer is on her bed.
Sami wasn't a perfect person at that time.

Don't worry. These things happen.
If you put your mind to it, and you really want it, you can achieve it, whatever it is.

Look down.
I love the internet.
Tom continued looking around.
Nothing happened.
Tom is willing to help you.
It's already dark outside.
Can Tom read and write Japanese?

All are present.
Gotcha.
Please continue until I tell you to stop.
Don't eat without me.
Tom consumes a lot of wine.

They saw him throw garbage into forest.
Tom told me to shut up.
I don't like my brother climbing the mountains.
I saw what was left.
I'll buy you a coffee at the cafeteria.
Tom was first one to do that.
I need a taxi!
I ran as fast as I could to catch up with Tom.
The horse is white.
Sami slept on the couch.
Tom must have been the first one to do that.
What did you say?
Sami isn't committing any crime.
But your ex is a psychopath!
He bought pencils, notebooks, dictionaries and so on.
He seems to have been rich before.
The weather is better today than yesterday.
I still feel strong.
Feed the chickens.

Happy International Women's Day!
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
I'm not very good at sports.
Take a look at this report.
I will make it clear for her, just in case.
Why did you cut down the tree? Did it bother you in some way?
Tom works for a trading company in Boston.
Tom came to Boston as a teacher.
Where did you meet them?
Mary answered her own question.
Shameful!
What he told me frightened me.
It's about 133 kilometers from London.
You seem an honest man.
I walked inside.
Dinner was awesome.
Right?
Tell Tom I feel fine.
I have met her before.
I'm happy to hear you're still working for us.
Most of the time he arrives late.
Winter is the season I like best.
You look as healthy as ever.
Tom is trying to attract attention again.
I'm going to wait until Tom and Mary get here.
Has Tom ever been to Boston?
Hopefully!
Tom couldn't think of right words to say.
I would leave early if I were you.
A ten thousand dollar fine? That's nothing.
Cars pollute a lot.
I think that Tom would agree to do that.
He became famous throughout the world.
Tom looks extremely busy.

Are you listening to me?
Quieter!

Don't let this get wet.
I have the right to criticise.
Tom wants to read a book.
Tell me why you didn't buy what I asked you to buy.
I like fish more than meat.
We should be in Australia by this time next week..
Tom and Mary live with their father in Australia.
I owe Tom an apology.
I saw Tom sitting in the third row.
Caution.
I worry about that sometimes.
Shit.
What's this smell? Did you get sprayed by a skunk?
Tom licked his dry lips.
Checkmate!
Tom and Mary hope they don't have to live in Boston for more than a year.
I thought you were a scientist.
Tom hadn't been expecting that answer.
Get used to that.
She speaks English and also speaks Swahili.
He lives in the city.
Nothing will ever change here.
We've got three major problems that need to be solved.
I didn't really need to wait for Tom, but I did.
Did she write anything in her diary yesterday?
I know that Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take us to do that.
I'd better get out of here.
San Juan is the capital of Puerto Rico.
You already know about what Tom did, don't you?

It's out of your control.
Tom is very curious about that.
I don't think that there's any need for Tom to attend the meeting.
Tom spends most of his money on food.
It's the same hat.
You recovered quickly.
She looks older than she is.
I didn't show Tom anything.
No one is going to tell Tom and Mary that they can't do that.
Look at what we made.
Why are you not telling the truth?
Tom had a bad headache.
I put my wife's glasses on by mistake.
They decided to quit their jobs.
Tell me when you will call me.
I want to see your older sister.
My front tooth fell out.
"How old are you?" "I'm 23 years old."
I cannot fix this machine. It's very difficult.
I don't know why Tom and Mary aren't happy.
Sorry!
Both flowers with the same value.
Mary let us know that she had arrived.
All people are not gentle.
It might help if you were the one who told Tom not to do that.
Tom is depressed.
Sami is gonna have nothing.
I knew it was them.
He brought up the old story again.
Tom promised that he wouldn't drink anymore.
Here, try my pen.
Quitting one's job in a big way is cathartic but is it the right thing to do?
It's starting to get light.
They have old construction equipment.
Please don't feed the monkey.
Tom is one of the thirty people who were arrested.
I teach Tom's children French three times a week.
Mary thinks that she knows the answer.
Old women like dating young men.
Should I tell her?
Tom and Mary are quite confident that'll happen.
Mary could've stopped doing that if she'd wanted to.
Tom wants more than that.
Stay away from my daughter!
So dramatic!
I don't have to move to Boston.
I'm in my car.
Tom and Mary would've done that by themselves if John hadn't helped them.
Where are you originally from?
Sami thought it was a coincidence.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
Maybe Tom and Mary weren't hungry.
Have you found your ticket yet?
How did Tom know we were going to be here?
Wait!
Tom usually only hires people he already knows.
You ought to take your father's advice.
Ask Tom where he put his keys.
Swimming isn't allowed in this lake.
I can't concentrate while you're here.
Nothing happened during the day.
I saw Tom's picture in the newspaper.
"Here, take it!" "Give me a break. I don't need it."
That was the best thing that could've happened to me.
I'll be in touch.
The pillow is too hard for sleeping.
Really?
This is the first time Tom and Mary have ever complained about the food.
Tom is on his way to Boston, isn't he?
I can't sleep if the lights are on.
Don't try to pretend you're innocent.
Was Tom seriously hurt?
I must've made a mistake.
It's possible Tom won't come.
She would never dye her hair.
They don't worry about what's going to happen tomorrow.
Call a doctor immediately.
Will you be able to come?
Tom is an outstanding actor.
He went to Gokdepe.
The river ran dry totally.
Hmm...
I know it was you who did it.
And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
How many girls are there in this picture?
It's an answer to Tom's letter.
I didn't realize that Tom and Mary wanted me to do that for them.
He says he isn't happy.
I want to learn the Berber language.
You don't really want to live there, do you?
She found him more handsome than ever.
Will you go, too?
I know Tom needs to do that today.
I'm sad when it rains.
It's too late anyway.
Tom is a good reader.
He said he enjoyed it.
Sami has been waiting for days.
I can't allow myself to buy a new car.
Who'll be in Boston with you?
You look like you're bored.
Sami is tired of his life.
I run before breakfast every morning.
I can't answer the phone now.
Sami can sit with whoever friend he wants.
Anyway, I'm just here for the night.
I couldn't agree with you more.
The fox and the bear lived together.
I just want to know what actually happened.
What's left to talk about?
If you don't have a pen, use a pencil.
Tom says he has to go to Australia the day after tomorrow.
Who gave you that envelope?
I asked the doctor some questions.
She told me that she found something.
I was in Boston just last week.
I asked Mary where she and Tom had first met each other.
I don't have to go if I don't want to.
Did anyone tell Tom where he should park his car?
I know what I have to do today.
Does she have children?
I don't think that you need to tell Tom that you're planning to do that.
How can I get Mary to fall in love with me?
I don't eat beef.
Write!
Rest.
Those are your choices.
Aren't you going to introduce me?
I saw you give it to Tom.
I miss you all.
Yes.
How is that relevant?
Do you feel unbeatable?
I have a lot of problems to deal with.
I had no idea you'd ever met Tom.
He wants to know everything.
Therefore?
Thanks for your advice.
Why do you work here?
Tom corrected what Mary had written.
He doesn't watch any television.
Why did you live in Boston last year?
She was born yesterday.
Tom has no diplomatic experience.
Do what you consider needed.
Do you like apples?
Proceed!
I lived in this house in the past.
Tom said that he'd be back soon.
I'll be here waiting for you at 2:30.
Eventually, Tom will tell me where he buried the treasure.
Did Mary say where we should meet her?
Tom said he can handle it.
Most workers get an automatic pay raise every year.
Tom thought he had a chance to survive.
We could write a book.
Mary does almost anything Tom asks her to do.
"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
Tom looks like he's bored.
Tom had to go to Australia with Mary.
We have a French test today.
I thought it was a good idea.
Why did you kiss me in the dark?
Meow.
Tom hasn't yet told me what to do.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
Tom came to Australia to look for a job.
You don't entirely trust us, do you?
Nobody's ever asked me that question before.
And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
Thank you in advance for your response.
Sami is in heaven.
Sami was working with Layla sometimes.
Do you enjoy visiting museums?
You did that all right.
I'm tired of singing.
I can teach you how to do that if you want me to.
What is it that you want?
What time does the train arrive at Boston?
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be here later.
Tom asked the same question to several people.
I try.
I think that's a very stupid argument.
Thank you for waiting.
Tom knew that Mary was in Australia.
You took the wrong bus.
Sami was trying to walk.
Mary shut herself up in her bedroom.
I thought I'd wear a tie.
It'll take care of itself.
"May I help you?" "Yes, I'm looking for a dress."
They learned.
Likewise.
What beautiful weather!
You really should visit Australia.
I gave my old coat to them.
I don't advise them to buy this car.
Tom is retiring.
Tell Tom we're ready to leave.
Marilla listened to the whole story.
Tom won't be able to find the money Mary hid.
It's the best season of the year.
Tom looks like he's bored.
Do you think that Tom will come to Boston?
He spoke to her about the matter.
May I borrow your bike?
I teach French to my friends once a week.
Layla lost her position.
Aren't you going to the game?
My phone's ringing.
She said she hopes you'll help her.
The whole nation wants peace.
Tom said he'd get home by 2:30.
I saw a hut in the distance.
Tom and Mary said that they weren't going to be late.
Tom and Mary have become close.
I'd prefer red wine.
I don't want to eat.
We'll make you happy.
I don't want to do that like that.
"Does she have a dog?" "No, she doesn't."
Did he write anything in his diary yesterday?
She slammed her hands on the table.
Tom gave us something in a small box.
Tom and I didn't like each other when we were teenagers.
The university was founded by his father twenty years ago.
Which do you think have more vitamin C, apples or grapes?
Flee!
I can't calculate the distance.
Tom seems to know all that already.
I don't think this is the first time Tom has tried doing that.
I'm glad I'm not Tom.
Right!
A woman is the most sweet thing in the world.
Is there any place around here where I can rent a bicycle?
Do not talk.
I'm going to tell the truth.
What is it that you want?
One day a man will fly to the stars.
Where?
These two brothers are twins.
A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
Sami doesn't need to teach Layla how to clean the house.
He's the perfect man for him.
Tom crammed everything into his suitcase.
You're not allowing me anything.
She said she's home every Monday.
Can you imagine how Tom feels?
I used to come to Boston about once a month.
It had all been a big mistake.
Tom is really a good dancer.
She doesn't look her age.
Tom told me he'd try to win.
What exactly are we having this party for?
I watched TV.
It was a tough exam.
Layla was grief-stricken.
Where do you come from?
Tom is from the South.
Mary is usually with her friends.
Is it next to impossible to live to be 150?
It isn't dark yet.
Everything I told you was true.
From now on, I will not use that word.
He isn't so tall, is he?
Don't you have something else to do?
Thanks for trying.
Mary shouldn't do that by herself.
Sami made a video on Youtube.
He told me he was lazy.
Tom and Mary exchanged numbers.
It belongs to me.
Please put it back where you found it.
Tom was living with us at that time.
I want to talk to him.
Seriously?
Oh, that's very pretty!
Everybody laughed.
They could've gone by themselves.
If I were in your shoes, I would help him.
He is not going to be cold.
I let myself get convinced by him.
It can't be done alone.
Tom didn't even try to get out of the way.
Have you got anything to read?
A wise person wouldn't do something like that.
Tom will miss Mary a lot.
Tom came here to use my computer.
Tom doesn't own a car.
He was seen to throw garbage into forest.
It's Anna's house.
What are you doing out here in the cold?
Do you plan to stay in Australia for very long?
He came after ten minutes
Learn!
Tom didn't seem to be having any problems.
Have Tom and Mary actually agreed to do that?
Careful!
Tom became a teacher.
I didn't even know we had practise.
Sami kept looking at the hoodies.
Tom changed his diet.
Tom's mother told him to come home.
I will try.
Mary brought her children with her.
Quickly!
Tom and Mary opened their laptops.
He is thirty years old.
Tom didn't even know Mary's last name.
Tom didn't seem to be willing to change.
He didn't even respond with one word.
There is a military base near here.
Tom has nothing to worry about.
You'll need some of these.
I'm in a great mood today.
You said that you'd give me your answer today.
She hurried to the station only to miss the train.
Mary is unsure what she should do.
Layla wouldn't survive a day in jail.
Mary may have said that, but I don't think she did.
The girl has spent all day crying.
The girl looked at him too.
I knew you'd fail your French test.
What is it you want me to do?
I suggest we leave before the guards see us.
What team do you cheer for?
Tom isn't likely to allow you to do that.
Retire.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
I get angry sometimes.
Sami forgot Layla's room number.
Do you believe in afterlife?
Could you spell that?
Two dogs guard the entrance.
Tom suggested that I go to Australia with him.
Mary seemed to understand why Tom didn't want to go to Boston with her.
Tom and Mary said they hope John can do that.
I saw Tom talking to Mary this morning.
Does anyone here know where Tom and Mary live?
That job was really difficult.
Mary says she hopes Tom can take care of himself.
Tom wasn't the one who told me you wanted to do that.
Algeria shares linguistic similarities with Morocco.
I didn't buy that.
I would rather read a book at home than go out tonight.
There's no money and there won't be any.
How long do baseball games usually last?
This teacher doesn't like children.
This is the best book I've ever read.
Mary is on her way back home.
Follow me.
Tom knew his plan wasn't very good.
It looks like he went crazy.
Can you count the stars?
This CD costs ten dollars.
Tom doesn't have to do that alone.
Tell me how to solve the problem.
Do you still play tennis?
Believe those who seek truth, beware those who find it.
Let us protect our peace!
Today's weather is somewhat better.
We deserve better.
Tom can't swim at all.
She has nightmares.
Do you know where my glasses are?
I'm not the one who's supposed to be doing that.
I was told that I should see a doctor.
You have the same answer to everything.
They told me they'd be careful.
No, I am not married.
It's still light outside.
I don't understand why that is important.
It's warm here all year round.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Sami waited for his mom to come home.
Why aren't you interested?
Can any of your friends speak French?
Today's weather is somewhat better.
Where did you hide them?
Tom is one of the nicest kid I've ever taught.
Am I stupid?
We could make it on time if we walked a little faster.
All people are not gentle.
I don't know if you'd understand.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary refused to even listen to him.
She can't speak English, much less French.
I thought you said you had something to tell me.
There's a vase on the table.
I've become accustomed to the noise.
He told me that he's lonely.
Godspeed!
Jump!
Tom is avoiding me, isn't he?
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek.
Mary is still texting on her phone.
I see fear in your eyes.
Tom rewrote it.
Sami enjoyed Layla's stories.
Three guesses where I was yesterday!
This bicycle belongs to my brother.
I don't live near where I work.
I have recovered from my bad cold.
Tom said I needed to get more sleep.
Die!
Tom and Mary started laughing when I told them what John had done.
Tom looks like he's depressed.
She saw a young man at the entrance.
Are Tom and Mary still in the hospital?
I used to go to school with him.
She has very large ears.
I think you need to repaint your house.
Tom and Mary always blame John for everything.
You will have heard this story before.
I still plan to study French.
You can't buy this medicine without a prescription.
You are too sensitive to noise.
My legs ache from sitting.
Listen!
Here, try my pen.
Sami was still reluctant to call the police.
Tom likes eating raw carrots.
Leave that alone.
Tom didn't even offer me a cup a coffee.
Faggot.
Let's play cards instead.
This is going to be fantastic.
I value my privacy.
I just bought myself a new jacket.
It's annoying to hear people talking loudly in a library.
Layla felt she was losing her friends.
How heartbreaking...
I'm a very good listener.
I read a book.
Tom nodded and left the room.
What's your major?
Tom told Mary she was his one and only.
Mary said that Tom was the one who told her that.
Tom and Mary clapped their hands.
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be doing anything dangerous.
I think I'm a lucky guy.
My dreams just get larger!
Wild!
Did he write anything in his diary yesterday?
I saw you outside.
Tom saw animal shapes in the clouds.
They said they wanted to be left alone.
I don't know what was in that box.
Unfortunately, I can't come tonight.
Tom and Mary are going to stay until the end.
Tom asked if I wanted to go to a party and I said yes.
How much is Tom paying you?
Tom may not make it on time.
The maid served the tea.
What's that horrible noise?
I need a bigger room.
Come here.
You can't outfox him.
Tom doesn't seem to be very nice.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
My brother advised me to stop smoking.
Tom is older than all of us, isn't he?
The doctor told Mr Smith to give up smoking.
It'll cost us a lot of money to do that.
Tom pretended he was afraid.
How many animals do you have at home?
Tom and Mary aren't very hungry, are they?
She's concerned about her future.
Why do I need to go to Australia?
I am memorizing the national anthem.
You don't have to do that, do you?
That makes me anxious.
If you have a question for Mary, ask her yourself.
The whole school agreed to the proposal.
You aren't afraid of dying, are you?
She told me she didn't like swimming.
She rewrote it.
They said they noticed a difference.
Do you want to come out and play?
Some people are not willing to change their eating habits.
I saw Tom less than an hour ago.
Three guesses where I was yesterday!
Sami traveled alone.
She studies English.
I think Mary has already done what she needed to do.
Tom spent time with Mary.
Let's call her Taninna.
I know Tom is still planning to do that.
Tom is now on some sort of secret mission.
This is the last time I let you go.
It is not easy to translate.
I saw Tom just this morning.
That's my pussy.
What beautiful weather!
That's one of my cats.
These people are anything but innocent.
The guy I met yesterday didn't give me his real name.
Think about it one more time.
Did you forget to set your alarm, Tom?
He tried harder to get good marks than I did.
What's your passport number?
How could you think anything like that about him?
Mary couldn't get her car started.
Why didn't you try and stop Tom?
She told me that she'd cried.
Here's my business card.
Mary knew it was foolish to go out by herself after dark.
The beggar rattled a few meager coins in his tin can.
Tom told me it was too hard for him to do.
Mary made plans.
Grapes grow on vines.
Sami and Farid are like best friends.
It seems that there was a misunderstanding.
He thinks he got a good bargain.
The flowers were bright and colourful.
Tom told Mary not to worry about what might happen on October 20th.
They've done everything they can.
She has always dressed and identified as a male.
What did you do yesterday?
Tom is going to contact you.
Why didn't you tell them that?
It can't end like this.
I almost never eat breakfast.
Mary went to the hospital because she was sick.
Tom is one of the bravest men I've ever known.
They could do it if they wanted to.
Where will you go?
Winter swimming isn't dangerous for healthy people.
We're supposed to try to solve our problems by ourselves.
Mary said that she wasn't in Boston.
Tom is exactly the same age as Mary.
They plan to have a party.
I'd like to spend my next summer vacation hiking and camping.
Tom doesn't want to do that with me.
She tried to conceal the fact.
I thought that you might like something to drink.
Take a tissue, your nose is running.
Tom majored in geology.
Tell him you'd like to help.
I'm here on business.
They did what they planned to do.
I wish Tom and Mary were on our team.
You'll find this lesson easy.
You're not well, are you?
Pay close attention to what I'm telling you.
Sami believes there is a god.
How unlucky I am!
Those sorts of hats are seen often.
Behold.
Is this wine good?
Tom is perfectly safe here.
Why is Esperanto an underestimated language?
This music suits my present mood.
I can't speak the Berber language, but someday I will speak it well.
Did you really not know Tom couldn't speak French?
My husband makes a hundred thousand dollars a year.
We quickly became friends.
I am one of those Israeli Jews who don't consider Palestinian Arabs as enemies.
Should we tell Tom?
Tell me you'll do it.
That would be a tragedy.
This is huge.
Hopefully!
Do you really think I want to go back there?
Tom didn't get anything.
I thought that Tom had enough money to buy everything he needed.
It's bogus.
Tom did everything he possibly could to help.
Thanks for trying.
Mary said she was going to go to Boston.
Tom and Mary don't want to study abroad.
I'll race you to the car!
Today is the twenty-seventh of March.
I saw Tom three weeks ago.
What Tom did didn't surprise Mary.
Right now, I suggest you concentrate on getting this report finished.
Sami took two of his dogs out for a walk.
Sami has a brand new car.
Here's another day in London.
He has financially ruined not only himself but his family.
Do you live near Tom?
The sun went down behind the mountains.
I didn't know why my car wouldn't start.
Have you got anything to read?
If it rains tomorrow, the tour will be cancelled.
Listen as much as you want.
I thought Tom would want to try some Japanese food.
Please refrain from talking.
We parted a year ago.
What is that on the wall?
Sami is scared for himself.
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
Tom is young and ambitious.
You look like you're looking for something.
Tom did badly at school.
Tom didn't want to tell anybody about what he had done.
They hit it off from the beginning and have been together for two decades now.
Did you buy a car?
Understood?
Did you remember to lock the car?
I forgot to tell Tom and Mary who was going to pick them up at the airport.
Tom is going to eventually learn how to do that.
He'll be back in two hours. In the meantime, let's prepare dinner.
Tom is a good runner.
Layla said she was from Egypt.
I've decided it would be better not to do that.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
The times are changed and we are changed in them.
Tom will get back from Australia this week or next week.
María is reading all of Dostoevsky's works.
Are your parents still living?
He has many talents.
He didn't even respond with one word.
Oh, baby!
Mary slid her sunglasses on top of her head.
I can't believe Tom doesn't like Mary.
Have you got anything to read?
He is just an ordinary person.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will leave for Australia.
Were you born there?
You said you would give me an answer.
Tom took a fifteen-minute break.
Do you want to come to do the shopping?
Catch up!
Peach trees require lots of sunshine.
Layla thought it was the perfect plan.
Two dogs guard the entrance.
Monkeys climb trees.
There's a vase on the table.
Hell's gate is open already?
I have no weapons.
I hope everybody is on our side.
The girl is extremely tall.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't drink any beer last night.
Tom promised to do that, but he didn't.
In the end, we obtained what we wanted.
I'm listening to music.
Mary didn't keep her promise to me.
They can't shout, they are dead men long ago.
Where can we find an ice cream truck?
He has never played golf.
I want to hear you play the piano.
Tom and Mary say they don't have time to do that.
How many cats do you have?
I don't have a clue.
You ran a red light.
He has nobody to take care of him.
When the war began, Tom was a little kid.
We don't have enough money to go to Boston by airplane.
Tom was lying when he said he didn't know Mary.
This isn't true.
It wasn't planned.
You can identify children's voices without any problem.
He gives the dog some meat.
What's your theory?
I'll eat it here.
Tom couldn't think of right words to say.
Sami wanted a real physical fight.
Where is the giraffe?
I feel like going outside.
Tom's real passion is art.
Stop brooding.
Tom couldn't understand what Mary was trying to say.
Return that book when you have read it, please.
I think that's a small piece of sausage.
Germany shares a border with France.
This is a big help.
I'm sorry, but I'll have to go home now.
You lost your glasses.
I always spend Christmas Day with my parents.
She dedicated her life to teaching.
I've seen children die.
What's your theory?
The Second World War was five times bloodier than the First.
She went to America for the purpose of studying English literature.
You'll save yourself a lot of time if you take the car.
Thanks for your advice.
I don't know what I should say.
Really!
I'm really happy.
I've got to phone Tom.
Sami is a friend from the university.
Apparently, Tom will be going to a university in Boston.
I had my pocket picked in the train.
Whose friend are you?
I'm happy I waited.
He has twenty children.
She says she can't sing.
I almost forgot to put my passport in my pocket.
Mary didn't know where she was going.
Tom asked for a back massage.
I'm asking myself a lot of the same questions.
Are you resourceful?
In autumn, leaves fall off trees.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Sami knows exactly what I'm talking about.
Is the door open?
How much is this biro?
Could you come and help?
I quit doing that many years ago.
I'm the one who made this.
Sami found out about Layla's lover.
It's your only chance.
Tom is an avid hunter and fisherman.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be confused.
I have a donkey.
Next!
Tom said that nobody else was there.
I am an engineer.
He sold me his old car.
Tom put the tray down on the table.
Can we get started now?
I hear she's a famous actress.
You don't seem to be interested in doing anything.
Tom and Mary are the only ones here who know John.
When air dries, it makes thirsty and cough.
That uncle of his often visited America.
He wants it.
Caution.
He shaved his beard.
Tom is already quite drunk, isn't he?
He was ashamed of himself.
Many people don't realize that antibiotics are ineffective against viral diseases.
Mary declined the invitation.
You have to speak French here.
We're pretty near done.
You can't compete with Tom.
I will go
I can't come tonight.
Tom and Mary have the same father but different mothers.
Tom came in second in the race.
Oh, that's very pretty!
I know that Tom and Mary are tired.
Promise me you'll come?
I haven't seen him since.
I heard her speaking English fluently, like an American.
A good citizen obeys the laws.
Tom was first one to do that.
The orange is on the table.
Sami began to ask about Layla's daughter.
It's sometimes difficult to do away with misunderstandings.
Just say nothing.
Tom and Mary have three extra tickets they want to sell.
Sami prepared a secret plan.
I didn't spend a penny.
I'll have to go and see what I can do.
I tasted the couscous and it was excellent.
Tom studied Mary's face.
I will be back soon.
I'll teach you how to do that.
I can't come up with a plan right now.
How many volunteers did you get?
I was on a trip to India.
I go to school every day.
I'm going for oranges to the fruit store.
He promised he'd wait for us.
Tom didn't answer Mary's question.
Tom thinks his parents are perfect.
I teach French to my friends once a week.
Sami wanted to go and look for Layla.
You made plans, didn't you?
Dan should be ashamed of what he told me.
How did you find out about us?
Stars twinkled in the sky.
When does the rainy season end?
Tom should leave things as they are.
Don't distract me anymore.
I don't think Tom knows anybody at our school.
I've never stopped loving him.
Sami texted Layla right after school.
Tom lay on a sofa with his eyes closed.
There is a lot of beautiful girls in the whole world.
Please close the fridge.
How is that spelled?
I don't like this candy.
Sami named his cat Farid.
I forgot that today was Saturday.
I'm going to buy it.
They warned you.
Everybody saw everything, but no one knows anything.
Mary said that she wasn't happy here.
Algeria imports billions of dollars of food every year.
The horse is not white.
The train arrived ten minutes behind time.
He has the habit of reading the newspaper while he eats.
I heard that Tom and Mary are studying French.
I will check it.
I wish to be a doctor.
He said that he could handle it.
False.
Mary phoned to say she's not coming.
Who knows?
Mary forgot her umbrella in her car.
I dream about her a lot.
I'm pretty sure they won't allow us to do that.
I won't let Tom go to Australia.
We're not allowed to swim here.
What's the message?
Nice job!
Mary says she doesn't want to hurt Tom.
You speak French better than I do.
Neither Tom nor Mary has many friends here.
She doesn't consider herself a hero.
Sami and Layla were walking arm in arm.
They were alone in the library.
There's a mathematical concept that I don't understand. Could you explain it to me?
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary.
I love my native language.
Sami is originally from Egypt.
Bedouins live in the desert.
There's one person in particular I'd like to talk to.
Don't cut it too short in the front.
Happiness isn't an app that you can download onto your phone.
Tom did as promised.
I rarely drink fruit juice.
We were the ones who did that.
Here?
You called?
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek.
Will you go, too?
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
She said she knew you couldn't win.
I don't live near where I work.
I'm going out.
Her computer is on her bed.
Ready!
The goldfish is alive.
We can't do what Tom and Mary want us to do.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
Mary is counting on you, isn't she?
Tom is on the same team as you, isn't he?
You have to speak French here.
Tom is still somewhere in the building, I think.
Three people are absent.
Isn't that a friend of yours?
Why did you let Tom and Mary do that?
Tom couldn't tell what the problem was.
I can't connect to the Internet.
He spreads gossip.
You must give it to him.
I doubt that Tom will cry.
That was nifty.
You had better make a reservation in advance.
I don't have enough money to pay all my bills this month.
We were the ones who did that.
I saw Tom last night in the library.
Tom, have you eaten anything?
Keep far away from him!
What didn't they get?
I found her in tears in her room.
Step forward and make room for others.
Sami's cash is gone.
Are you twins?
Tom can't stand up straight anymore.
Mary was willing to do that, but Tom said she didn't have to.
I have two nephews.
I wish that I hadn't been late for the exam.
He leads me into the stable, and urges me to choose from all the horses whichever I would like.
Where was Tom hiding?
My son is taller than I am.
Do we have enough food for everyone?
An artist is known by their work.
"There is no right or wrong way to get fat," said Tom.
The bricklayer calculated that he would need 500 bricks for the wall.
How did you know that Tom didn't like Mary?
Tom should probably not tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
She will be jealous.
Let's take them with us.
Tom gave me an apple.
I've visited my father's grave.
I'd probably have approved.
Tom earns less than $10,000 per year.
Who said that? It's totally wrong!
She said that she was jealous.
This water is polluted, do not drink it.
How old's your son?
The whole Earth was shocked.
I've got a fever.
Tom and I were both pretty busy yesterday.
Sami's dog had respiratory issues.
Go more slowly.
Sami prepared a secret plan.
Sad.
Tom is absolutely wrong.
I know it's hard to believe.
Mary said to tell you she's sorry she can't be here today.
She was listening to music.
Tom asked Mary if she would dance with him.
You need a ride?
You said that you'd give me your answer today.
I'd like to swim in this river.
Tom isn't the one who gave me Mary's phone number.
She is a poor cook.
Tom knows Boston.
I don't think I'd be interested in doing that.
Are you really Canadian?
That's something to think about.
How cute!
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
Give me another one.
Don't look down on poor people.
We appreciate your interest.
They might've done that by themselves.
Stop, please.
I don't know who Fadil is.
Mr Bakir was our gym teacher.
I saw Tom take it.
I'm sure Tom will think we shouldn't sell our house.
Tom became quite wealthy.
Sami is a teenager.
How did your sister die?
Tom wearily closed his eyes.
You can't mix oil and water.
Work slowly.
The jewel was stolen during the night.
Not every student has a dictionary.
Mary is the same age as Tom.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't ever do that again.
Sami walked his dog around the building.
I would like to know who my parents are.
Sami's managers literally hated him.
He often sings in his car.
I know Tom is a lazy person.
I learned to drive a car and got a driver's license when I was eighteen.
You should come as well.
Mary hasn't listened to the speech yet.
The old woman is crossing the road.
Layla needed to go back to her house.
I can't do that tonight.
Tom just wouldn't listen to me.
These are my friends. Their names are Tom and Mary.
I'm taking a tomato.
He was seen to throw garbage into forest.
She walked away without acknowledging me.
Tom was close to tears.
She's a fisher.
Hope you didn't mind.
He broke his ankle.
Home!
What did you do today at school?
No one will give us any money.
Can't anyone else come?
Tom and Mary say they won't cry.
Everything I said was the truth.
The gate opened and then closed again.
Just shut up.
The soldier said that death is not to be feared.
Breathe.
Work!
Likewise.
Ow!
How many apples have you eaten today?
Most of the time he arrives late.
You didn't recognize me?
Here, try it on.
He hid his weapons.
I wouldn't work in Australia even if you paid me double.
I wish I had been with her then.
Tom and Mary thought John would be bored, but they were wrong.
Boston wasn't cold when I was there.
It'll be a long time before I can afford to buy a house.
Aren't you going to be on vacation next week?
He wished he had more money.
Sami was at his mom's house.
You just called me old.
He knew where he put his pen.
I should have guessed Tom would do something like this.
Good.
Sami read the next story.
I can't help drinking.
No pain, no gain.
I cut myself a slice of bread and it fell on the floor.
Mary is moving to Boston, isn't she?
We'll show them who we are.
The old man starved to death.
You encouraged us to do that.
Mary's grandmother is toothless.
Is it a crime to do that?
He didn't understand me.
Boys are noisy and rude to girls.
You must open it for him.
Tom's parents hugged him.
I can't condone what you did.
After a thousand-year sleep, the dragon woke up.
We watch TV together.
I'll be waiting for you after 8.
Tom told me he'd never let me down.
Will Algeria change?
I have so much to do.
Crazy!
I don't think Tom and Mary have ever been in love.
Mary eats too many prepared foods.
Impossible.
Sami succeeded.
Mary warned you.
Let me tie your shoes for you.
Did you go shopping yesterday?
Thank God.
Tom and Mary didn't tell me they couldn't speak French.
This isn't the first time that Tom has lied.
How much is she paying you?
My father took me to a movie last night.
I'd try to keep Tom from doing that if I were you.
I usually try to eat a healthy lunch.
His goal is to become a millionaire.
Sami was trying to protect me.
Sami went there every day.
Tom glanced at the others.
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary wants to buy with the money her father gave her.
Tell me how to use the washing machine.
Tom and Mary are suspicious of each other.
I saw Tom jump into the pool.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Tom will likely do that, won't he?
That's a different discussion.
Sami is not doing that.
The students stood up one by one and introduced themselves.
The horse is black.
Die!
Mary couldn't help but laugh.
He likes his new job.
You ought not do that.
Sami knows Layla is sick.
Sami turned around and asked Layla why she was following him.
Do you think Tom will pass his driving test?
Over the holidays, I'll learn to swim.
She was born yesterday.
I will make it clear for him, just in case.
I'm not going to study tonight.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done everything he was supposed to do.
Sami was talking to a camera.
Tom was born there.
I thought I'd be fine.
The world could use a lot more people like her.
Tom said that Mary was ready.
I'm OK.
Do you like books written by Franz Kafka?
I think you know that Tom isn't going to be here today.
Tom wants you to kill Mary.
Tom has about half as many books as I do.
I know it was you who did it.
Can you see your own mistake?
I opened the can, but it was empty.
You never listen. I might as well talk to the wall.
Tom liked Mary for years, but at some point, his feelings for her changed to love.
Mary and Kate talked about their school and their friends.
She wouldn't let anyone help her.
Tom cried for an hour.
I had trouble getting the door open.
She's painting her nails.
Tom and Mary wanted to pay off their loan.
Mary's going to be disappointed.
You should read the introduction at the beginning of the book.
Can you play the piano well?
May I go, too?
Tom is graduating tomorrow.
The bird is in heaven.
Hold on.
Will my signature be enough?
We could stop somewhere.
Nobody came to help me.
Does she speak English?
I have a feeling he has something to say.
Who cares if Tom does do that?
These pearls look real.
Your sorrow is my sorrow.
We need to talk about them.
She's laying the book on the table.
Tom did badly at school.
I learned by heart 2000 English words.
Since Tom can't drive me, I'm going to take a bus to the airport.
The river is five feet deep.
I didn't know that you were such a good cook.
Tom gets his hair cut about three times a year.
Start.
The government carried out a reorganization of scientific research activities in the 1990s.
I think I would've heard the door open if Tom had come in.
Which do you like better, bananas or apples?
Tom and Mary looked for their pens.
Do you promise never to lie again?
She has very large ears.
Sometimes it's better not to say anything.
Tom and Mary said they weren't going to be there.
Be our guest.
I'm going to come back the day after tomorrow.
I don't want to ask for help.
This elevator doesn't stop on odd-numbered floors.
Tom and I were like brothers when we were children.
He wants to know everything.
How many times a week do you go to the movie theater to watch movies?
Tom was trying to cheer Mary up.
He changed a lot since the last time.
Tom's house looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years.
Tom commutes to work by bicycle.
What do you do?
Sami was preparing his speech.
I'll put the kettle on and we'll have some tea.
I thought Tom would come alone.
He is not clever but stupid.
Sami didn't worry about Layla.
Say good things to each other.
We never should have left early.
I have found your dirty little secret.
Understood.
He has scars all over his body.
What time does school start in the morning?
They're still in Boston.
Tom and Mary may have some problems we can help them deal with.
I saw Tom's car in the parking lot.
Tom came just before dinner.
Tom never walks anywhere.
I watched TV.
Tom won't permit you to do that again.
Tom disclosed his intentions.
Tom is a student at Harvard, isn't he?
I told Mary that Tom was mad at her.
Sami needs to chill.
He is not going to be cold.
Tom and Mary think that they know what's going on.
I'll put it on my calendar.
Tom doesn't know how much I love him.
I like living in Australia.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Mary says she feels a little better today.
He is not going to be cold.
Tom identified Mary's body at the morgue.
Don't worry about them. They're just jealous.
Sami wanted to steal Layla's pills.
I'll permit you to go.
It's time for action.
This is apparently a good sentence.
Tom and Mary didn't tell me where they went.
I forced Tom to do it.
You're too lazy.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I heard Tom playing the violin.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
Shit.
He hates snakes.
Kill me with words!
I advise you in my capacity as a doctor to stop smoking.
I really like you a lot.
Move out of my way.
By the time the ambulance arrived, Tom was already dead.
Where's the beach?
Tom wanted to do that this morning.
I just don't like it.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
I'm getting thirsty.
The whole world could be destroyed by an atomic war.
Hmm.
His house is at the foot of Mt. Fuji.
It seemed very odd.
Tom bought a small camera to take on his trip.
Tom has a problem and he wants to solve it.
He has nobody to take care of him.
Hand me the water carafe.
I called Tom on his cell.
Sami didn't want to talk about that.
Tom is terrified of his father.
Are you good at playing basketball?
Tom eats out three times a week.
Can you read that sign ahead of us?
Thank you for the cake.
Tom isn't feeling great.
Scoundrel!
Tom went back to Australia.
Liar!
You ought to tell Tom to do that more carefully.
She speaks English very well.
He fries the eggs in oil.
Impossible!
That was more interesting than I thought it would be.
Sorry! I'm not good at explaining.
You're bored.
Do you know what Tom looks like?
Tom and Mary don't know who they should ask to help them.
I can't agree with you here.
Tom expected Mary to come soon.
Mary said Tom waited for her.
I can't take your money.
This is the last time I let you go.
I got airsick and felt like throwing up.
Is there anyone who doesn't love me? I don't think there is.
Have you decided on a name yet for the baby?
Agreed.
You should come as well.
That's an entirely different matter.
She's a fisherman.
They contradict themselves constantly.
Ask Tom to clear away the dishes.
Tom will likely go to Australia during his summer vacation.
You may invite whomever you like.
Stop talking.
I am not old.
This is not a table.
He did that by himself yesterday.
I don't want to be a teacher.
Let's speak French.
Mary knows she doesn't have much choice.
We arrived at a compromise.
We just want to go home.
We know you're working for them.
I don't want to know what you have done with that.
Sami's glasses are always dirty.
The Spaniards are a friendly people.
Tom's work environment was good.
I'm the only one here who understands French.
The car isn't clean but dirty.
Tom's voice is soft.
Her boyfriend was there, too.
I don't want meat.
Tom won't likely tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
Tom was getting hot.
Tom has a date with Mary tomorrow afternoon.
I must come in.
A good person is a moral person.
Tom is cooking dinner.
Tom wanted to live in Australia with his family.
It's been a long time since we last met.
They must come with their kids.
Tom was born on the same day that his grandfather died.
Will you be going?
The weather bureau says it will rain tonight.
I saw Andrea leaving home.
I'm getting tired of hearing you say that.
Do you think Tom was the one who taught Mary how to drive?
Either Tom is wrong or Mary is.
You met him at the university?
Tom stayed in the hospital for three weeks.
I don't want to love Mary, but I do.
Sami didn't offend anybody.
She fries the eggs in oil.
I know Tom doesn't want to be there.
Don't read in this room.
Are you sure you're sick?
Sami saw Layla pass by.
Tom says I have to study French.
It is not easy to translate.
The entire nation was glad at the news.
Can you please tell me what's happening?
They live on the other side of the road.
He isn't sure if he's right.
Layla managed to crawl to the doorway.
I remember when Tom and Mary were babies.
Wait for us.
Clearly!
Do you know their address?
Kill me with words!
I baked some brownies for Tom.
I have a stupid question.
What are you doing to achieve your goals?
Tell me what should be done.
My mom was a wonderful woman.
Tom called me almost every day.
Tom was told by his doctor to remain in bed.
Did she write anything in her diary yesterday?
She cannot find her bonnet.
The Second World War was five times bloodier than the First.
You did that without anyone's help, didn't you?
She borrowed my shirt without asking.
Pardon!
I suppose you think Tom and Mary are really stupid.
The teacher permitted him to go home.
Don't worry about them. They're just jealous.
Ask!
Tom saw how you were doing that.
DIY.
I really like Mary, but I'm not sure I want to marry her.
Monday will be a busy day.
A book worth reading is worth reading twice.
Will Tom come with his wife, or alone?
Where's the marketplace?
I asked Mary what she meant.
I won't do that if Tom and Mary are going to do that.
Layla will never forget Sami's eyes.
Can I take those books for you, teacher?
I'm going to come back here tonight.
I should've explained everything to Tom.
Tom told everybody that he was unafraid.
I've sent her home.
You ran into him earlier, didn't you?
You don't have to like Mary. You just have work with her.
I cannot make noise. The baby is sleeping.
You should allow Tom to do that.
Everyone should get out of here before someone gets hurt.
I eat a lot of rice.
Journalists collect information with the goal of providing the most accurate version of events.
Did you hear how quickly he speaks?
Don't eat sweets between meal times.
Tom and I sometimes jog together.
Tomorrow is the wedding. Everyone needs to look very festive.
I don't see your point.
Nobody can beat Tom.
I think I'll go see Tom and Mary and ask them what they think.
I have too much homework.
Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't done it.
Study!
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help very much.
Excuse us for a minute.
We'll have fun with it.
Mary promised Tom she'd do what he asked.
I think that Tom is introverted.
Tom and Mary said that they want to sell their house.
I didn't ask Tom to sing.
You finally came.
They don't eat.
I'll let you know beforehand.
That's nothing you need to worry about.
She is bored.
I'm going to release you.
May I borrow your bike?
They scared us.
How many hours did you work yesterday?
I'm not your teacher anymore.
Are you listening to me?
Tom's dog has black and white spots.
I've already told this to the cops.
It's boring to stay at home.
We should be able to do a lot better than this next time.
Sami stole the phone from a store.
I don't yet have a present for Tom.
Human life is short.
Tom doesn't believe in ghosts.
He was beating his wife.
They are good people.
Where'd you buy that scarf?
I want the young members to be more active.
Tom cried himself to sleep.
They don't seem like themselves.
That teacher sometimes hits his students, but no one ever complains.
Sami was watching what was going on.
This shouldn't be possible.
I think that the book is interesting.
Tom and Mary kept their eyes shut.
I heard my name called by someone.
I wish you'd told me the truth then.
I cannot make noise. The baby is sleeping.
Is the skirt not too short?
This music suits my present mood.
Tom and Mary told John that they didn't want to do that.
Mary gave Tom directions to her house.
Have you told Tom about what happened yesterday at school?
Mary couldn't do that, could she?
Would it bother you if I smoked here?
Tom called his wife to tell her he wouldn't be home for dinner.
Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
You know quite a lot about Sumo.
Wrong.
They say they don't wish to do that.
I heard a loud noise.
I never oversleep.
I don't want to do that the way Tom suggested.
Tom is extremely busy today.
Sami heard about that.
It may rain in the evening.
Tom is going to Australia tomorrow.
Why is Tom here? He should be in school.
Hello.
I chewed.
Do you like it? I like it.
Tom came to pick me up at 2:30.
Mary has a blog on Tumblr.
I'll never be able to do that again.
Play there.
Tom knows how to talk to children.
This chair is too small.
Layla left Sami for another man.
That's really great!
Sami nearly lost his home.
They think that they're good drivers.
I can't help being fat.
There's a chance that Tom will eat with us tonight.
I don't want him to hear.
To what do I owe the unexpected honour of finding you here in my house?
Tom and Mary aren't as old as they look.
I told them you already knew.
The student body is opposed to the new rules.
Can you tell Tom how you did that?
My past caught up with me.
I heard a voice cry "Help!." I was laughing.
He hung up his coat.
This is the place where Tom and I first met.
Tom chaired the meeting.
Why don't you eat some vegetables?
Sickness changes people.
They were here earlier, weren't they?
Tom says he doesn't want to live in Australia.
He said that he disagrees.
Sami wondered how the panties got there.
I want to know how much time Tom has spent in prison.
Tom should help Mary.
I don't think Tom and Mary like anybody.
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
Tom desperately needed money.
Tom knew I was involved.
You can't take it with you when you die.
Is there room in your car for me?
I will make it clear for you, just in case.
I knew Tom went to this school.
Thank you, Jesus.
You are a good student.
I hope Tom isn't tired.
If Tom and Mary are going, I'm going, too.
She has to stop smoking.
Can I talk to you about something that's bothering me?
Mary makes her own bread.
Tom and Mary consulted with their attorney.
I feel alone. That's why I have so many friends on Facebook.
Smaller classes mean a higher standard of education, and that's what we want for our kids.
Sami can help you with this.
I decided to be a doctor.
Sami read all those books.
Have you ever been mugged?
Tom came down with a cold and couldn't go to school.
Thanks in advance.
There is a hole right there.
Tom will do anything to get what he wants.
And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.
I'm too tired tonight.
Did you say this to me?
Do what you consider needed.
I used it when I was in China last summer.
Tom doesn't want to be a surgeon.
It looks like Tom and Mary aren't interested in that.
I don't think Tom and Mary know you're here.
I don't want to stay here tonight.
Tom is just talking to himself.
Everyone liked her.
He's not ready.
Don't forget to take the medicine the doctor gave you.
Resign.
Sad.
I can't concentrate on that problem right now.
It is windy today.
How deep?
Tom said that he wanted to give Mary another chance to do that.
They were waiting for the go-ahead.
I don't have to go right away.
Tom said the park was beautiful.
I need medical assistance.
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston by yourself, is he?
Don't you recognize me?
Tom wanted a divorce.
Thank you!
Don't sit on the rocks.
Sami was frightened.
He's not sick.
I'd like to go there with you.
He goes to school, doesn't he?
Tom can't give it to you now.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
They have two wonderful children.
We are in the same class.
I've never met a kinder man than Tom.
Tom said that he thought that we could win.
Tom couldn't think of any reasons why Mary wouldn't want to go.
Could you please proofread this for me?
After having walked six kilometers, he felt tired.
I translated.
No two words are identical in meaning.
How are you?
Tom dreams of world peace.
Hares can swim.
It's over nine thousand!
We have to start at dawn.
Tom wasn't frustrated, but Mary was.
He keeps surprising me.
Do you see the stars?
No, I didn't see it. Do you think I have eyes in the back of my head?
I'm unable to say.
He is our driver.
Here's a short list.
Where are you from?
From my position, I cannot see the tower.
We need to speak to Tom.
How many years did Georges live there?
Get it right!
Tom worked all day long.
I'd like to offer you your job back.
We've seen this happen too many times.
I translate only for my manager.
I will make it clear for her, just in case.
Tom unscrewed the cap and handed the jar to Mary.
I didn't know what to do when Tom and Mary said they wouldn't help me.
Tom isn't barefoot, but Mary is.
She takes a taxi from the station to her house.
Layla lost her position.
Well, goodbye.
This rope is really strong.
I like all colours but I like green the most.
Both teams are unbeaten.
What would you do in my place?
He is my teacher.
Tom massaged my shoulders.
Layla doesn't celebrate birthdays.
They're going to have problems.
How is Tom able to do that?
Nevermore!
That's all I can do for now.
This is the best book I've ever read.
Tom realized he wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
We were walking.
Tom was my boyfriend three years ago.
Tom and Mary didn't notice that they were being followed.
Tom was born rich.
Tom was raised in a happy family.
Password?
Mary said she thought she could do that by herself.
He is bored.
I don't usually speak French.
He'll go fishing by himself.
They are all ears.
Mary shot me.
I hear you've done some pretty extreme stuff.
I have too much homework.
I'm in Australia now.
They're cooking now.
Even though it's against company policy, Tom and Mary kiss and hug every time they meet.
I see myself in the mirror.
Listen.
If I don't wash my hair for a day, it becomes slick with oil and flat.
Duck!
Jim likes the doctor.
Tom thought that his parents were perfect.
Tom and Mary are unusual.
Mary had enough money to buy what she needed to buy.
This sort of thing doesn't happen where I come from.
It isn't hard to do.
Would you like to contribute?
Then, the train screeched to a halt.
I just need to talk to her.
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
I'm an idler.
What's happening to Tom?
Sweet!
I think you are a really nice person.
Nay.
I didn't want Tom to leave.
Don't tell me anything, I already know everything.
It might take years.
I don't know who Tom plans on going to the zoo with.
All big cities have traffic problems.
Mary is really different, isn't she?
I won't complain about that.
If you have questions for Tom and Mary, ask them yourself.
Tom couldn't think about anything else.
Drop your weapons!
Look what happened to them.
This diagram will illustrate what I mean.
You're the only person I know who likes getting up early in the morning.
Had it not been for the money, we would not have succeeded.
You know what this is, don't you?
She saw a mouse.
I will make it clear for her, just in case.
What's the name of this tree?
Tom and Mary lost their jobs three months ago.
Why is that so funny?
Tom has been working since late last night.
They loved this game.
Escape.
We'll meet him later.
Going somewhere?
I am a graduate student.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
We call him Mike.
Exactly!
Is it OK to trust Tom?
She spreads gossip.
Many firms are competing for the wealthier segment of the market.
If you don't stop taking the drugs, you will die soon.
Give us time to talk about it.
Mary said she wouldn't agree to do that.
Tom is doing a good job, isn't he?
If you put your mind to it, and you really want it, you can achieve it, whatever it is.
The end of the world is close.
I doubt I'll be successful this time.
Flee.
Tom hadn't been expecting that answer.
Again?
I left Australia three weeks ago.
You encouraged us to do that.
He gave $300 to each of his sons.
He said he didn't like his new job.
I read jokes almost every day.
What is it, dear?
How many minutes ago did that happen?
Tom and Mary told me they'd visit Boston.
She did not want him to leave.
I'm sure Mary will be able take care of herself.
I've dealt with the matter.
Tom is a fast worker.
I don't want the same thing to happen again.
How are you?
She died on a cold night in December.
Did you fill out the questionnaire?
They said that they're not going to sing.
The girl has spent all day crying.
Her face turned white at the news.
He's in his room, isn't he?
I promise to never be late again.
Nay.
Where did you shave them?
Strange.
He hates snakes.
I have the impression that Sami doesn't like me.
Let's not lose our patience.
She asked me to throw her the ball.
Have you made progress in your studies?
It's urgent!
Tom went bankrupt.
Kill!
They kicked Tom out of the bar.
He was beating his wife.
Tom sat alone on the porch smoking a cigar.
Is this door always locked?
We are in a Berber-speaking society.
Tom and Mary said they enjoyed last night's party.
Tom didn't want to be eaten by wolves.
I think that Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Why would Tom need to do that?
Have you ever seen an elephant?
We're still doing well.
Masaru gets married today.
She borrows novels from Tom.
Mary did it by herself.
Tom would do that if he had more time.
She respects her parents.
Both flowers with the same value.
What color are your new shoes?
Will you come in here a minute?
We leave for Boston in the morning.
I didn't know you were a romantic.
They quickly became close.
One thing is certain: Algeria is changing.
It has four legs, it is made of wood and it lives in the kitchen.
I can't even remember where I bought this.
Dan dropped out of college and started looking for a job.
Things were happening pretty quickly.
What kind of music do Tom and Mary like to listen to?
You know that eventually everybody's going to know about this.
A quarrel between husband and wife is like a spring day's drizzle.
How many years did Georges live there?
Tom wanted to hire us both, but his boss would only let him hire one of us.
Did you say that Tom and Mary are your friends?
I have a problem, and I want to solve it.
Are you able to swim every day?
Godspeed!
I've visited my father's grave.
We like to add new members to our group.
You had better not see her now.
If you don't have any goal in life, you're just waiting to die.
It's a Canadian company.
You have three hours to meet our demands.
On which chair did you put the book?
I have more questions for you.
I have the dictionary.
With the time passing, his respect for him became love.
Is there anyone else around?
I thought Tom and Mary weren't allowed to eat candy.
Bye!
Tom and Mary are waiting for Tom to come.
What's this smell? Did you get sprayed by a skunk?
I don't think that Tom realizes how difficult this job is.
I wouldn't work in Australia even if you paid me double.
Where are the friends?
Does Tom have a big family?
Is Chinese your native language?
He scared us.
Tom and Mary hope they'll be able to get back to Boston next October.
Mary says she's thinking about moving to Boston.
Tom and Mary are in their offices waiting.
Tom loved his grandchildren.
Tom enjoys manipulating people.
Mary is going to get her chance.
I'd try to keep Tom from doing that if I were you.
It isn't a fake.
Tom is permitted to do that, isn't he?
Be quiet, all of you.
We should probably get you to a doctor.
I see no reason to continue.
I promise.
Tom and I've decided to go to Australia together.
Thank you for the cake.
Good luck.
He stopped what he was doing.
Sami can do whatever he wants to do with his life.
"Are you making fun of me?" "No, I'm not."
I work hard in the garden.
I don't think that Tom will do that today.
Aren't you going to go there?
What were you doing in Boston last week?
Done.
I dine at seven.
Polluting isn't good for improving the environment.
You have to wait.
You look like you're going to pass out or something.
Tom didn't mean to do it.
Beware!
She cannot be accepted.
Sami is trying to calm Layla down.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary know what they're doing.
I searched all over for Tom.
I looked for my cup, but didn't find it.
The prey dies once, while the hunter dies every day.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do that.
Tom opened the door, even though I asked him not to.
I won't betray Tom.
I am not rich but poor.
He has no one to blame but himself.
I do not have to listen to that.
She told me that she'd buy it.
It's just not what I do.
Tom lives in Boston with his wife and his three children.
Don't let Tom eat dessert until he's eaten his vegetables.
Tom went to sleep happy.
Likewise.
It'll take us hours to finish this.
He seemed bored.
No trees exist higher than the Eiffel Tower.
Mary is waiting for her husband to come home.
They were worried about their health.
Can I come, too?
Sami is not here to make friends.
I think that Tom will call Mary.
I think Tom wouldn't be lonely if Mary were here.
How many novels did you read last month?
Tom took risks.
Allow me to explain.
My office is significantly brighter than yours.
Tom worked as a waiter at one of the most popular restaurants in town.
Do what you say and say what you do.
Tom doesn't seem to be as relaxed as Mary seems to be.
Tom wanted to find out the cause of the accident.
Mary said she'd take care of it.
I don't think this is the wrong road.
The soldier aimed his gun at the man.
Tom visits Mary every time he's in Boston.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be cooperative.
Hmm.
You and Tom used to be friends. What happened?
Would you like a seat?
Let me have a look at those photos.
Are you studying chemistry?
You may as well begin at once.
Layla is dating Sami's brother.
I don't want to go to church.
I need to get her home.
You're bored.
I doubt that I'll be successful this time.
Tom still hasn't returned.
He had to rewrite his essay.
Call a doctor immediately.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be curious.
Sami went to church every Sunday.
He mostly talked about his trip.
I wonder why Tom is so popular.
Tom couldn't understand why his company's products weren't selling well.
Tom said that he wasn't thirsty.
"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
I think I'm in trouble with my wife.
She is bored.
Me!
You're quite right.
Don't lock the door.
Tom wondered where he might have put his passport.
We need to work now.
He isn't going to be courageous enough to do that.
I am sorry.
Tom has a different job now.
Mary said she didn't smoke.
Tom came down with a cold and couldn't go to school.
I know what you said.
If you don't have a pen, use a pencil.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary wants to do that.
Move along, please.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I can't come to the phone right now.
I won't have time on Monday nor on Tuesday.
That's not butter. It's margarine.
I've been waiting for the bus for an hour.
It gradually dawned on me that I had taken the wrong train.
I told Mary to help Tom, but she didn't.
Mary wouldn't do what Tom wanted her to do.
I have one dog.
Tom died of thirst.
What's going to happen when they find out what we did?
Wrong!
Sami was not lying.
Tom passed away three months later.
Linda's fruit is bad.
He needs to change his socks.
Tom never forgot where he came from.
It's not quite three o'clock.
Tom and Mary don't want to meet you.
I don't think Tom and Mary are the people you should be talking to.
I'm still driving the same car that my grandmother gave me.
It's hard to forget his first love.
What is it you want me to do?
Tom had to do different things.
You should not be afraid of the future.
Focus!
I don't think Tom lied to us, but I know Mary thinks he did.
Tom hasn't decided what he's going to do.
She wasn't so sure herself.
We had only one chance to do that.
Nothing.
I knew Tom wouldn't know how to do that.
I was plenty nervous.
He gave a nice present to me.
During the night it's very cold.
I grew up here in Australia.
I don't think it was your fault.
Sami's hair is dry now.
Do you think we can trust Tom?
She put her shoes on.
If you look from afar, most things will look nice.
Maybe Tom will give me a job.
I saw Tom on TV.
I haven't heard from him since last June.
I don't like my wife calling me at work.
Tom wears the same clothes that all his friends are wearing.
I can't come right now.
Tom had no desire to win.
Tom and Mary are still trying to figure out why that happened.
He married for money.
We're ready for the next step.
I don't think that Tom knows how Mary feels about him.
I'm getting used to this new machine.
They eat meat very rarely.
Were you jealous of her?
It's said that she loves him.
Tom didn't agree to do it.
Sami was so skinny.
Where's my sister?
I'm not scared of Tom, but Tom is scared of me.
Will you be able to come?
He looks quite happy ever since he got married.
Don't touch it.
Oil and gas are the main resources Algeria has.
I can't lie to Tom again.
We were walking.
Nothing more is needed.
What happened doesn't change anything.
Why is grass green?
You know this isn't fair.
When?
It's easy for Alberto to learn.
Contact Tom Jackson for details.
Mary brought her children with her.
Tom and Mary said they were mugged by three men.
Just say nothing.
It would probably be interesting to do that by yourself.
Tom and Mary said that they were nervous.
Milk the cow.
I don't think Tom's answer is wrong.
Mary saw her parents arguing.
I have no idea.
Study!
Greetings!
I remember reading the book.
My husband makes a hundred thousand dollars a year.
I know that Tom is dead.
Mothers often pamper their children.
I don't speak German, but the Germans themselves I love.
Do you know why Tom decided to do that?
Tom has promised never to do that.
The event starts at 3pm.
Tom and Mary were angry with themselves for being late.
I have a feeling he has something to say.
Attention please!
Sami was very Muslim.
Sami liked the babysitter a lot.
It's sometimes difficult to do away with misunderstandings.
Bravo!
Akira uses the same dictionary that her father used as a student.
I've never bought clothes online.
"Whose ears are these?" "They are Mickey Mouse's."
Live!
We sold our forest.
How could you understand what I'm feeling?
Mary is the same age as Tom.
You must give it to them.
Do you go to the same school as Tom?
I think that the book is interesting.
How much did those onions cost?
This is not a fish.
Drink!
This swan is black.
I thought Mary might be permitted to do that by herself.
I thought Tom would be present at today's meeting.
It's my decision!
I don't know anyone I can practice speaking French with.
You're the only person I know who likes getting up early in the morning.
Tom buried his face in his hands.
The price of bananas hasn't changed much over the past few years.
He's a somehow very similar face.
Nobody came.
Mary hardly ever keeps her word.
Sami tried to make the bouquet look nice.
When you're 17, you don't understand those who are over 40.
Alex will answer, "Color!"
They still haven't untied my hands.
She has very large ears.
I wasn't the one who yelled.
We're going to build stores in Austria.
Tom is considered dangerous.
I'm sorry, but I'll have to go home now.
How would you react if your wife told you that?
Mary said she'd take care of Tom.
I saw Tom take your keys.
I saw Tom running down the street.
Sami never said anything about that.
Tom saw a light in the distance.
Has it ever happened before?
I always knew I was adopted.
Tom hugged his parents.
My parents are going to love you.
The train had to stop because there was a tree lying across the railway line.
Tom is supposedly very wealthy.
I'll replace her.
Tom and I lived in the same house and went to the same school.
We saw the waiter coming through the door.
Come!
I won't tell her.
Having met him before, I recognized him at once.
I don't want to sit with you.
The economy has entered a recession.
Are you listening?
Sami was watching what was going on.
I can't.
I hope Tom didn't leave his umbrella on the train.
She will not do it.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't alone.
I don't know who Tom has decided to give his old bicycle to.
Scoundrel!
It's a cellphone.
Mary couldn't remember her password.
Tell us what that is.
Mary and Tom are dreaming about the sea.
Thanks for your help.
I hope you change your mind.
He is not going to be cold.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
Tom has been decisive.
Tell your men to drop their guns.
Which would be more convenient for you, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?
Tom whispered something to Mary and she left the room.
Sabotage!
I'd like to come over after work.
I won't take your money.
Do you think I ask too many questions?
I'm sure Tom will be home.
I'm listening to music.
I met you, and that's enough.
I don't care what you drink.
I see I'm wasting my time.
Mary hadn't been expecting that answer.
Do you love your mother?
I don't know your reasons for not liking Tom.
Hello?
Do Tom and Mary know where you bought that?
I saw Tom smile.
Mary left her keys on the table.
I didn't realize Tom was busy.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
Sami shouldn't worry.
He found my lost bike.
Stars twinkled in the sky.
Why is Sami at the hospital?
Oh! Show me, please.
Will you please tell me the secret?
Tell me why you didn't buy what I asked you to buy.
Who let you in here?
John went to the bakery to buy bread, but he was disappointed when he found out that there wasn't any.
They are living in another house.
I thought I did the right thing.
Tom's proposal wasn't acceptable.
What for?
Tom doesn't have to apologize to me.
Forget it.
Tom is counting money now.
Police continued their investigation.
You ought to take your father's advice.
He looks like he's uncomfortable.
Tom wants to go and see his father.
Mary is mean to everybody, isn't she?
If Tom isn't careful, he's going to run out of money.
Tom says he isn't afraid of ghosts.
How did your sister die?
He seems to be very sleepy.
We made sure of it.
I didn't know it was possible to get there by train.
Quick!
They saw a mouse.
Mary said she isn't likely to win.
They cooked all their own meals.
Tom is easygoing.
Tom couldn't understand why she wanted to learn French.
Sami needs your help.
Please don't leave town.
You said you needed me to help.
Tom told me he thought that Mary still wanted to go to Boston with him.
I asked you to stop.
Mary says she doesn't know anybody here.
Tell me when you will call me.
So?
You think me an idiot? It's because I'm talking with you.
Tom was still angry even after Mary apologized.
I bought some bread on the way home from work.
I have a clock.
You must give it to them.
Something always goes wrong.
Who do you think is the GOAT of tennis?
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Aren't you going to buy that?
I won my first gold medal.
This photo is my favourite!
Mary should tell Tom what she wants to buy.
Are you always this quiet?
What did you do this morning?
We need to have this researched by a biologist.
I'm at the airport right now.
Thank you for dancing with me.
Sami knew that Layla was cheating.
I should go to the city to talk to him.
Can you speak Turkmen?
Sami wished he was that guy.
She is reading.
Cat!
I have a headache.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't helped.
Tom said that I didn't look like a teacher.
I want to know whether or not you'll be ready by 2:30.
Would you mind helping Tom and me?
I don't remember.
Sami can take a picture of us.
The horse is white.
You never told me where you lived.
It's the third today.
You wouldn't do this if Tom and Mary were here.
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Mary just got her driver's license.
Was that you who coughed?
My skin is as white as milk, my hair as golden as ripe wheat; I am as fresh as the leaves in spring.
This is an error.
It had all been a very big mistake.
You know that I don't need to do that, don't you?
Mary has lived there all her life.
Tom said that he thought that we could win.
We made plans.
Many people lack humility.
Very!
We can still make it on time if we hurry.
We're speaking Turkmen.
I didn't wake Tom up at 6:30 like he asked me to.
Tom came to France with the intention of studying French.
Do you speak Macedonian?
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in Australia?
My father didn't eat much fruit.
He said he wants to join our band.
I heard you whisper.
Tom used the internet to look for a job.
Sami was Layla's neighbor.
Dead?
Tom and Mary said they weren't expecting John to do that.
Tom fixed the broken watch.
Have you discussed this with anybody?
It rained every day Tom and I were in Australia.
I have a thing for Tom.
Choose.
Mary said she's learned a lot in the last three years.
Tom has a hard decision to make.
They didn't look like they were busy.
I don't have a hundred dollars.
Did you get a massage?
Could you stay and help me?
He kept me waiting there for more than an hour this afternoon.
Try to calm down.
Had he tried it once more, he would have succeeded in it.
I'm the one who told Mary that she should study French.
Tom and Mary often play chess together.
Do you and Tom still hate each other?
Stars are shining.
I thought Tom and Mary weren't busy.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary are really studying French.
I see a star.
Tom might be coming to Boston next week.
She has plenty of friends.
Mary couldn't do that, could she?
Aren't you alone now?
Tom told me why it was a good idea to do that.
He is a taxi driver.
I could barely sleep.
Why would I kiss Tom?
I have no way of knowing.
I thought that I saw Tom kissing Mary yesterday.
Quieter!
Boston is my home now.
Hope you didn't mind.
Did you hear what he said?
Fire burns.
I had a great time with you today.
Why aren't you doing what I asked you to do?
She's a lot tougher than she looks.
Do you really trust her?
How old was Mary when she passed away?
He had to share his bedroom with his brother.
Sami's mom wasn't there.
If you can read this, it means that you can speak one language!
I don't think Tom is planning on helping us.
Why don't you let Tom know you aren't going to do that?
Why are people afraid of her?
I like to study at this cafe.
She said that she was very tired.
She fries the eggs in oil.
I knew you'd like Boston.
Do you think I ask too many questions?
Can you give me an example?
We work well together.
Your speech lacked some consistency.
"Well, there's something I'd like your advice on about my research project ..." "Let's see... Hmm, you're investigating flowering plants then."
Listen as much as you want.
They are reading.
He takes pride in his work.
All three of us need to go to that meeting.
How much is this biro?
Everything I told you was true.
I know that Tom can't speak French.
We should be fine.
That's where I want to live!
Tom came in through the back door.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
Tom claimed the inheritance.
Tom isn't likely to be arrested for doing that.
I've got to stop Tom.
He didn't even respond with one word.
Maybe it would've been better if I hadn't done it.
You have to come back in 30 minutes.
It's sad to see Tom so unhappy.
I saw Tom last night.
Tom and Mary both cried.
I work at Chuck's Bar and Grill.
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary.
I have two cats.
Pull over.
I'll check that.
We were working together.
Hope Jane's there.
Tom gets my vote.
The interview began at 10 o'clock.
This weekend, I promise.
Tom is going home now.
Tom is a successful banker.
I want to drive.
You said you would give me an answer.
He said he'd do that later.
That made me very sad.
The doctor tells me not to touch alcohol.
The students stood up one by one and introduced themselves.
You're in for a pleasant surprise.
I didn't make it any better.
Do you often go to the movies?
The swimmers are entering the water.
I promise that I won't drink.
Give us time to think it over.
Damn thief.
I may not have time.
Sami wanted to have fun before the snow melted.
Pitching isn't easy.
I just wanted to make sure I hadn't done anything wrong.
I'm sure you all read about it.
He refused to let me in his room.
When was the last time you cut your nails?
Many people lost their homes after the earthquake.
Morning!
Tom is brushing his daughter's hair.
Tom hasn't decided what he's going to do yet.
Life can't be stopped, it always goes on.
They need to cancel their flight.
Answer!
Has he ever snored?
If I don't tell him, who will?
Impossible!
How much time will you be in Australia?
Sami's teacher was really nice.
I'm at the airport right now.
Sami was beaten with a heavy belt.
Tom came in last in the race.
Can you give me an example?
She's complete faith in her boss.
I did nothing all day.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
She has a rich boyfriend.
I like Chinese food a lot.
The opportunities here are boundless!
May fifth is Children's Day.
He often talks about his work.
She'll come even if you tell her not to.
According to the paper, there was an earthquake in Mexico.
We're speaking English.
What bird cannot fly?
I wasn't very interested in what was going on.
Etna is a volcano in Sicily.
Mary is quite crazy, isn't she?
She will come back soon to visit us.
There was disagreement between Sami and Layla about the dogs.
I expected worse.
I refuse to obey you any longer.
You can't outfox him.
Tom's wife is just as crazy as he is.
Which do you think have more vitamin C, apples or grapes?
Mary needs to change her socks.
Tom may do that later.
What do you think Tom wanted?
All his family was around him when he died.
Tom thought he should go.
What happens if Tom dies?
It is raining.
Stop, please.
Did Tom and Mary say they'd go to Boston?
It's quite likely Tom will come.
I'm a new employee at Microsoft.
Thank you for waiting.
Please.
Mary realized she might die.
Tom and Mary told John that they were impressed.
Stop embarrassing me.
Mary is much richer than you think she is.
Sami knew Layla better.
Tom is massaging Mary's shoulders.
It wasn't planned.
Of course this is my real family name. Here's my passport.
I don't want to be left here in the dark.
Did Tom actually go to Boston?
I have to go to sleep.
Is it true that you built this house by yourself?
She's teaching students English.
What part of Canada do you come from?
It's about 30 minutes from here on foot.
Were you translating with the help of a dictionary?
Tom decided to enter the room.
We won't be here much longer.
I thought it went well.
I won't die.
Why do you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Mary told me she couldn't do that by herself.
No, I am not married.
They're part of the family.
When did Tom say he was coming?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Mary is very sure she can take care of herself.
Think!
What do you feed your cats?
The meat's not ready yet.
You and I seem to be the only people here.
She can't speak English, much less French.
I spend all my day in front of my computer.
Anne locked the school door and went home.
Once I helped her.
He was seen to throw garbage into forest.
Follow me.
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
I had a good summer vacation.
I have nothing to do now.
How old is the Bible?
I feel a whole lot better today.
When was it purchased?
Life's unfair.
Algeria is huge.
This seems to be a pretty busy place.
Tom said that he hasn't yet done any of that.
It is strictly forbidden to translate this sentence!
She scared us.
These are a kind of nocturnal flowers.
You must open it for her.
Why is grass green?
Never mind what I just said.
Tom came to Ashgabat yesterday.
Tom is used to hard work, isn't he?
Tom and Mary think I don't know what happened.
Tom didn't want justice. He wanted revenge.
He said that he only did that once.
We thought that we wouldn't be able to stop him.
What programs do you watch on TV?
Tom said that you wanted water.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
If you can read this, it means that you can speak one language!
I was born and raised in Matsuyama.
Recently.
Sami turned around to close the door.
I don't think I'll succeed.
My mom was a wonderful woman.
I didn't think Tom would enjoy Mary's concert.
I've been learning to drive.
I hate being watched.
How's everything with you?
Tom and Mary have done everything they wanted to do.
I apologize for any problems that I may have caused.
He was elected captain of the team.
Those sorts of hats are seen often.
Girls are strange sometimes.
It's about thirty minutes from here on foot.
I can't answer that question.
When did you come?
Tom and Mary hope that John will like the present they bought for him.
What part of Canada do you come from?
My whole body hurts.
Do Tom and Mary still have keys?
It wasn't until long after they got married that Tom found out that Mary was wanted for murder.
I left Australia three weeks ago.
He's always complaining.
Didn't Mary tell you she'd do that?
Mary wanted to stay with her mother.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think John really knew how to do that.
I want to spend more time with Tom.
I have no idea.
Tom eventually moved to Boston.
Where is your honey that excites the bees, Pyragy?
I really wanted to do that with you.
You probably think Tom is deaf.
He's a very clever boy.
All of us got into the car.
Tom has never been to Boston.
Sami always talked about money.
Jack will not answer my letters.
Do you know why Tom decided to do that?
Thank you for waiting.
I have climbed Mt. Fuji before.
We don't get much rain.
Can you help me when I move?
I saw Tom's pictures.
Tom misses his wife and children.
I could not for the life of me figure out what was wrong.
These are questions that only Tom can answer.
It was a very happy time in my life.
Sami's restaurant was in the mall but it had its own entrance.
She studies English.
I owe you ten dollars.
Tom had better hurry if he wants to get home before dark.
And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
I thought I'd be fine.
Divide the pizza among you three.
Don't let anyone open the windows.
Tom said that he thought that he was too old to do that.
This is the guitar I like the best.
Dunno.
I wish I could stay with you.
Sami never told the truth.
We did this.
I can't take your money.
I think Tom is still angry.
I am baking bread.
It looks like he went crazy.
Tom isn't as chubby as he used to be.
Answer me.
She doesn't talk much, does she?
Is that too heavy for you?
I'd like you to leave now.
Anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won Anthony's liking she had, somehow or other, won his respect.
Whatever.
I work with dangerous materials.
We went to New York by plane.
I doubt I'll be successful this time.
There will be an extra charge.
Tom and Mary saved all of the letters John sent them.
Tom and Mary did that much better the third time they did it.
If you don't feel like doing it, don't do it.
Do you really know why I'm here?
The building's on fire.
A friend of mine is looking for someone who can speak French.
Tom worked all day long.
Put the pillow case on the pillow.
She is my wife.
Tom and Mary have told me they'll do that tomorrow.
I had a motorcycle before.
Mary says that she doesn't blame us.
If you see any mistakes, please send a message.
I saw Tom's daughter last week.

Those terms are not acceptable for us.
He says he has plenty of time.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
Do as I ask.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
Sami didn't order anything.
The brain serves many people who have no power, but power serves many people who have no brains.
I'll stay here a whole month.
Mary said she didn't know the answer.
You don't need my approval.
I don't think Tom and Mary have to get up so early tomorrow.
He is a taxi driver.
I don't like talking about the war.
I might go to Boston next autumn.
Sami couldn't eat.
I cannot express my gratitude with words.
Hold steady.
I wouldn't have visited Boston if Tom hadn't told me to.
I don't like places or people either that haven't any faults.
Sami didn't even brush his teeth.
I married him against my will.
I'm going with Tom to Boston.
Stay away from the dangerous neighborhoods.
I will try
Hugs!
Is that too little?
Straighten your legs.
Thank you in advance for your response.
I've known Tom since we went to school together.
He came into the hospital to visit me.
I think that Tom is a really nice kid.
Escape!
Many people believe that money brings happiness.
Who were you looking for?
He's able to speak Berber fluently.
I owe you ten dollars.
Could you press this button?
I'm happy.
I want to sleep.
Don't you realize that my work is very serious?
I had a great time with you last weekend.
Understand?
Tom called 911.
Don't worry about them. They're just jealous.
My speech will only be about three minutes long.
Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I need to do that.
Tom doesn't have to answer any of these questions.
There has been progress made.
Mary takes good care of her car.
I made this.
Tom wanted it to be over as soon as possible.
I don't want to kill anybody.
Emily was listening to music.
We have something we need to tell Tom.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
They want it.
To what do I owe the unexpected honour of finding you here in my house?
Neither Tom nor Mary went to Australia.
Tom and Mary hoped they could do that.
Mary wanted to learn how to defend herself.
They haven't yet admitted they did that.
There's a bus stop neighbouring our school.
Tom will be embarrassed.
Don't tell me how to do my job!
Why did Tom want to go?
Tom is happy again.
She has very large ears.
You cannot please everyone.
It was kind of funny.
Now you're accusing me of murder.
She said that she's healthy.
We're saying "Thank you" to the great King.
Tom didn't want to change that.
I think it's not worth the risk.
That's great! I'll look at it later.
Sami was very much older than Layla.
Ask her to come tomorrow.
What is your major?
Can you play the piano well?
Mary said she'd be at this afternoon's meeting.
We've all said nice things about Tom.
I forgot to speak with Tom.
Hmm.
He told me about his dog.
She speaks both English and French.
We will have some visitors one of these days.
Mary said she'd been offered $3,000.
It's really gorgeous.
Tom came to Boston hoping to find a job.
She will be jealous.
I know what you must be going through.
I will eat.
Tom tried to trick Mary.
Those people might be able to help us.
Go.
My essay isn't very good.
Drop everything.
Yep.
My baby began crying, asking for milk.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
They looked like they were in a hurry.
She has a scar on her chin.
I'm thinking about applying for that job.
Do you want a job?
Did Tom give any other instructions?
You must be pretty rich.
He hates his neighbour.
He hates snakes.
Push off!
Eureka!
Bring that blue box in my garden!
The company, wholly owned by NTT, is doing well.
Many of the children were barely clothed.
Are these your glasses?
Maybe it's best not to tell Tom.
I'd like to offer you your job back.
It is better to risk saving a guilty man than to condemn an innocent one.
He always hires a friend of a friend.
I don't understand why Tom didn't want us there.
Don't touch it.
I think we're going to return soon.
And whose fault is that?
You should buy your ticket in advance.
Don't sit on these boxes.
She didn't finish her dinner.
Sami wants to talk to his sister tonight.
He said that he had to leave.
He hates snakes.
I'm going to Ashgabat.
I wrote Tom three letters last month.
Mary told Tom that she was ready to leave.
Can you introduce yourself in a few words?
Let's stop doing that.
Tom certainly didn't vote for her.
All you have to do is give this to Tom.
These are too small for you.
Sad!
His proposal was not acceptable.
Alright.
He was supposed to give it back to me last week.
I'm not as innocent as you think I am.
I don't remember.
Do you know where my key is?
You must do that more carefully next time.
I almost felt bad for him.
Is there a bus stop nearby?
I am not married.
Zoom in on this picture so we can better see it.
You know that eventually everybody's going to know about this.
He shaved his beard.
I saw what happened.
Mary didn't light any candles in her room.
Read.
I wasn't very busy today.
Welcome to Mars!
Everything went smoothly.
He did it not once, but twice.
Tom's clothes are soaking wet.
The police arrested us.
I don't think we should agree to do that.
Four plus three is seven.
Get your clothes on.
Mary didn't hurt anyone, did she?
I was taking pictures.
You might just see Tom, too.
It doesn't rain here very much.
Tom said that he thought Mary needed to get more sleep.
I used to smoke a lot, but now I've quit.

How much is this T-shirt?
That's interesting, but beside the point.

How are you?
He's studying biology with great enthusiasm.
It hasn't been easy for Tom.
Tom knows not to do that here.
I'm a nonsmoker.
You might need the calculator now.
Did Tom and Mary say where they found your wallet?
Of course, Tom can speak French.
Read after me.
The solution of one may prove to be the solution of the other.
Mary doesn't often admit that she's wrong.
The apple fell.
Don't walk on the grass!
I know that Tom is infuriated.
I can understand French.
I didn't mean to give that impression.
I told you I didn't want to go to Australia.
My father gives my mother all of his salary.
I usually only just drink water.
You may use my pen.
I lived in Australia before I moved to New Zealand.
I was needed here.
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.
Repeat!
This corn is fresh.
They told me that they'll do that tomorrow.
I never had the chance to say goodbye.
Would you like to go fishing with us?
Enter!
Be quiet.
I love Evelina Sašenko.
Oregon is just south of Washington.
Cool!
You'll understand how terrible this accident was when you read the article.
Layla was sixteen years old when she put on hijab.
He doesn't have what he wants yet.
I don't ever want that to change.
They can take anything they want.
Naturally.
Do you remember talking to them?
The family members sat around the table.
I want to thank you for picking Tom up after school.
How does Tom intend to fix this?
I figured you already knew that.
Which do you like better, bananas or apples?
I see her in my dreams often.
That's a lie!
That's going to be my horse.
She's living by herself.

Tom will miss Mary a lot.
Gotcha.
I was beginning to have my doubts.
That one is big.

Tom would like it if somebody did that.
It's a good idea, but tell that to nature.
Sami wasted a lot of time.
This is the first time Tom and Mary have ever complained about the food.
He will go to the dentist.
Even if I wanted to do that, I don't have enough time.
Racism exists even on television.
How are you?
A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
Nothing, I'm not eating anything right now.
Is your mother at home now?
Tom came here today looking for trouble.
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Mary is mad at you for lying to her.
Did you get a massage?
What's been stolen?
I'll be here this evening.

I did it because everybody else did.

I haven't had the chance to do that yet.
You didn't understand me.
Pardon!
Tom probably won't be able to get home by himself.

Tom doesn't think you should have done that.
Tom, you should go, too.
She advised him to take a long holiday.
I was halfway to Boston when my car broke down.
I know that even the most beautiful kiss must come to an end.
Sami found the ad in a movie magazine.
We saw a boy run over by a truck.
She thinks she'll get straight A's.
They're fisherwomen.
He took his seat.
I don't want anyone to talk to me.
Do you ever take an afternoon nap?
For lack of qualified teachers only pupils with the highest grades were allowed to learn English, the rest had to take Russian.
I supported the committee's decision.
Great expectations.
Tom complimented me.
The sports car was going so fast it was just a blur as it passed by.
Layla just kept yelling.
I said that from tomorrow, I would smoke no longer.
Water is the only thing I drink.
I might go to Boston, too.
Tom made me go.
Please don't listen to him.
He hasn't seen anything like this before.
I don't have an explanation.
My roommate, who can't hold his liquor, came home after the party and barfed all over my new shoes!
She trusts her doctors.
Try to learn some grammar.
I saw Tom shoot Mary.
She is neither at home nor at school.
Ridiculous!
He finally decided to propose to her.
I should've waited until Monday to come back to Boston.
Bastard!
Tom repaired my bicycle.
Could you go get some wood for the fire?
Do you want my job?
I'm the one who built this house.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
I was told that I should see a doctor.
You're usually busier than me.
Tom says he can do that for you.
Sami was the first person to start calling me "Fred."
He will not do it.
Deal?
I just can't help smoking.
We all make mistakes, but people forget them.
We rewrote it.
Peace.
Tom will go to Boston with me.
Do you know what Tom looks like?
I want to go to Boston with Tom.
Tom has returned from Boston.
The walls were bare.
I've never met a kinder man than Tom.
Come home!
There's a good chance Tom will win the race.
Tom said that Mary wasn't excited.
I don't remember my password.
She's pretty, but dangerous.
You stole my husband.
Tom was born on a cold winter morning.
Tom isn't like us.
I have a jealous husband.
He will go to the dentist.
Exactly!
Sami did that shit on purpose.
A woman is the most sweet thing in the world.
Mary said she wanted something hot to drink.
I think that Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Every member must attend.
This has nothing to do with Tom.
Could you come and help?
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
Tom barely recognized Mary.
We don't know what happened to Tom.
Now, listen!
Tom can't come.
Why do you put so much sugar in your coffee?
Our dog got lost. Will you help us to find him?
I don't think that I know Tom as well as you do.
That is unconfirmed information.
I'm going with Tom tonight.
I see I was wrong.
I say what I think.
Where do you think I met her?
The store happened to be crowded yesterday.
Do you think I don't know what I'm doing?
How did they do?
I don't think Tom and Mary have ever seen one of these before.
Tom and Mary have said they intend to pay back all the money they owe.
It isn't hard for everybody.
Tom was important to me.
I thought you'd like to know what happened.
We have a simple philosophy.
Do you love your mother?
Don't send it to me anymore.
You should express your opinion.
Something was hanging on the coat rack.
You did that, didn't you?
I don't think Tom knows anyone who's able to do that.
We're ready to go if you are.
You are my pride and joy.
His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
Without Tom's help, Mary would have failed.
Sami was texting other girls.
They say that they did that for the money.
What does that mean, exactly?
Thanks for your help.
I'm not in the mood to do that right now.
He saved the boy from drowning.
I don't think Tom and Mary know where they should be.
Fadil seems to be in a really good mood today.
You lost your glasses.
Tom is likely to get lost.
If I were you, I'd think twice before going on that route.
Mary has never told me where she met Tom.
I'll do that tomorrow even if it's raining.
Fadil gave a full confession of what happened.
He is not clever but stupid.
Is she going to wait for me there?
That's a different discussion.
I didn't know anything about Australia at that time.
You seem confident.
Leave the door open when you leave.
I want to visit Korea.
I asked her to wait, but she left.
She loved his mother.
They focused on their work.
Tom and Mary argue quite often.
People die in wars.
What's your name?
A careless person is apt to make mistakes.
Can't anyone else come?
I think that I'm a lucky guy.
I fell asleep before the end of the movie.
I love cooking for you.
Tom asked me to come back tomorrow.
Whatever!
They don't have to go to school today.
Tom can't give it to you now.
Some evenings I'm so mentally exhausted after work that I just crash in front of the TV.
Bring me lemon tea, please.
Sami doesn't live on a farm.
He's in his bedroom, isn't he?
All three of us agree.
I have a cough.
Do you think it would be better to write Tom a letter?
I think I do need some glasses.
In killing Layla, Fadil used three different knives.
Tom doesn't remember the last time he saw Mary.
Don't you have something else to do?
Tom doesn't want to spend more than $300 for a used motorcycle.
I'm sorry, but I can't stay for long.
Sami is one of our employees.
Sami tried to kill her.
You'd better do that at once.
Mary does everything by herself.
Tom and Mary say they'll do that whether you like it or not.
Mary ate the apple Tom gave her.
The choice is all up to you.
Mary looks like she's alone.
Tom doesn't want to apologize.
Beware!
Where was Tom yesterday?
It's this month's magazine.
Mary raised me.
They are reading their book.
I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.
He hates snakes.
Layla wanted to leave.
Where did she try doing that?
Never dare you to call me a thief again.
They're still unsure of themselves.
How many times an hour do Tom and Mary do that?
Over winter came spring.
Look out!
Tom didn't know Mary had done that.
I should've known that.
Tom left Australia a few days ago.
I should be able to get there before 2:30.
I know you'll enjoy Australia.
I think I could've done that by myself.
Don't forget to wish Tom a happy birthday.
I hope Tom isn't tired.
I had to fire them.
I'll never talk to you about my buddies again.
Again!
I teach geography.
This guy needs oxygen.
How do you spell "bludgeon"?
It isn't true that Tom saw a monster.
Sami is staying with me.
Sami knows that Layla is not a bad person.
A curfew was imposed on the city.
Do you know how to juggle?
I had my pocket picked in the train.
However, I won't know whether he came or not.
She advised him to take a rest, but he didn't follow her advice.
Where'd you buy that scarf?
I like none of them.
Tom can't stay for long so let's get the meeting started.
You know that I love all three of you.
I know precisely how Tom feels.
I have a stomachache.
Sami has an issue with you.
Tell Tom we're ready to leave.
Tom and Mary didn't mention what they'd done.
I went to Paris.
Is it in working order?
Mary told me she never uses shampoo.
There was a chicken.
It's because Tom loves me.
Tom has proven that.
It'll probably be expensive to do that.
Did you remember to lock the car?
I told you I'd help you.
Do you have a match?
It isn't really that relaxing.
It belongs to me.
I think that Tom can help Mary.
I didn't know where Tom was taking me.
I don't remember when I took this picture.
Tom is at home for the whole day.
I was in the pool yesterday.
Inhale.
Are these real?
Tom promised me he'd come back.
Unbelievable!
I see myself in the mirror.
We were together about three years.
I can't wait to tell Tom about this.
What did I ever do to Tom?
Don't give them any ideas.
I don't know if you'd understand.
I understand.
Is Tom allergic to anything?
Tom served as chairman for three years.
Where is he from?
I knew Tom wouldn't be afraid.
Come!
Sami was waiting for Layla to get there.
Sorry...
OK Tom, what would you do?
Sami was having his lunch.
They want to know what's going on.
This is the teacher I had a crush on.
Do you know when Tom will return?
Mary made her position clear.
When did you come?
I told you to never speak to me again.
Tom wants you to kill Mary.
The new house is beautiful.
Mary is the same age as Tom.
Sami likes Layla's cookies.
We're not here to judge.
The brain serves many people who have no power, but power serves many people who have no brains.
Who are you calling stupid?
Correct!
You should advocate disarmament.
Stay away from my daughter!
Tom is in the conference room, getting ready for the meeting.
They can stay as long as they like.
I would like to ask for a translator.
You were cutting the bread.
I saw Tom try to kill himself.
Sami is a bad boy.
I asked Tom if he knew anyone who taught French.
We need to go to Boston to help Tom.
The happiness and sorrow of others is happiness and sorrow of our own.
That's nothing you need to worry about.
I don't always do that that way.
Sami got on Layla's Facebook.
I can't believe you just called me fat.
She could feel the sun on her neck.
I always worry about things that don't really matter very much.
Mary is easy to talk to.
I wanted to become a doctor.
Don't throw away this newspaper!
Since both Tom and I were sick, we didn't go.
Learning a foreign language as a non-native speaker is hard work, but all that effort pays off when you realise you can communicate with someone from a completely different country in their language.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
They can't touch me.
Tom and Mary hoped they could do that.
It was dark when we reached the hotel.
You must open it for them.
I don't know why Tom spent time in prison.
I want to get up and dance.
Pleased to meet you.
Are you sure it's hers?
Frankly, I'm not overly concerned.
I have two arms and ten fingers.
I don't want to wake the kids up.
My home country is Algeria.
Tom says he'll do that tomorrow.
Tom can't stop me.
She has nobody to blame but herself.
Is it okay to trust Tom?
Sami ate two bowls of the soup.
I'm not at all satisfied with this result.
I need you here now.
I'll buy you a coffee at the cafeteria.
This is my desk.
They are loyal to their master.
Thousands of people gathered there.
Tom says he didn't study French.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
Water temperatures in the Baltic Sea exceeded 23° C in some places.
Tom said that he was quite busy.
Can I talk with you alone for a moment?
Sami is being rude.
I don't want to speak French.
We want to return to Minas.
He came into the hospital to visit me.
I already know what I should do.
Wonderful.
Tom never told me why he didn't do that.
What he told me frightened me.
I'm getting sent to Australia again.
I'm sorry that I had to cancel our date.
The pen I used to write is red.
I went for a walk to the forest and I got lost there.
I can't calculate the distance.
Tom isn't able to do that tonight.
Empty your briefcase.
That has nothing to do with our business.
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
Have you fed the cat?
Did Tom speak French to you?
My mother is a high school teacher.
I assure you that we care.
I'm a doctor.
We were pretty confident.
The next meeting will be held at Tom's new residence.
Do you want to come to do the shopping?
I can't possibly do that alone.
They asked me where they should put their coats.
The road to Nagano is closed to traffic.
Dan didn't even take a shower.
Tom and Mary eat lunch by themselves every day.
Tom is young, but he isn't innocent.
The silence was unbearable.
She can't see without her glasses.
Would you like a seat?
Write with pen and ink.
He translates faster than others read.
How do I know this is real?
We don't repair PCs here.
You aren't taking that job in Australia, are you?
Definitely!
You missed your chance.
We'll tell them.
He was seen to throw garbage into forest.
Tom knows that I'm right.
Mary knows she has to help Tom tomorrow.
Tom doesn't like remembering about the past.
I gained their trust.
In 2013, Tom relocated to Boston.
I found the key I had been looking for.
Tom was wearing a gray suit with a red tie.
Mary said she was asked to help.
Tom kindly answered questions.
Tom is a good listener, isn't he?
His father is a policeman.
Do you like being with me?
Listen as much as you want.
Somebody should teach her a lesson.
You stay out of my life and I stay out of yours, OK?
I saw Tom in the parking lot.
Sami stores the hatchet in his toolbox.
Tom and Mary are going to lose.
Tom doesn't have to tell me anything he doesn't want to.
Drive slowly.
Is that all I am to you?
Tom was able to trick Mary.
I don't think I'll succeed.
Do Tom and Mary have lots of friends?
I know that Tom misses you.
Tom was transferred to the head office in Boston.
Sami was so skinny.
During that time, we only heard about thieves, about murders, about men who had died of hunger.
Yes, this is a wine.
I should have advised Tom to wait.
Mary is respected by everyone.
Tom and I won't leave until this weekend.
He is finishing reading the book.
We need to eat something.
We did that a week or more ago.
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
We've got three major problems that need to be solved.
Tom is a pretty good French speaker.
Open source.
How unlucky I am!
Mary is Tom's mother.
Let's drink something else.
Sami didn't lose any box.
My stomach hurts.
All the players stood there with their arms folded.
Ticket, please.
Tom was given thirty years.
I'm sure.
I was a sophomore in college the year Tom was born.
Tom is going to put his house up for sale.
Tom took Mary to Australia for a week.
I didn't know you were a romantic.
Everyone watched them carefully.
I get homesick sometimes.
Tom is cooking dinner.
Tom and Mary won't change their opinions.
How many novels did you read last month?
I know you'll enjoy Australia.
You can't compete with us.
He's studying biology with great enthusiasm.
Stephen died.
You must give it to her.
Tom cringed when he saw Mary walk into the room.
You may as well keep it a secret.
That smells bad.
This child talks like an adult.
You'll need this.
Money's a little tight.
Tell Mary she has to do that.
Tom is usually home on Mondays.
I studied French for three years.
You may use my pen.
Food!
Rubbish!
It's bogus.
Layla has never been to a school dance.
He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches.
Unfortunately, that's completely impossible to do.
I hear Tom and Mary don't drink tea.
Aren't you going to the game?
There's a fountain in front of the station.
I tried to explain that to Tom.
Listen as much as you want.
I didn't know that you had a dog.
What's your passport number?
I lost the watch my father had given me.
We can understand everything she's saying.
I am a boss.
Who told you I'd be able to do that?
The bags were piled up behind him.
He married a pretty girl.
She waited.
Flowers bloom.
I shouldn't have said the things I said to you.
I'm too tired to cook tonight.
I had a great time with you last night.
He took risks.
Nobody knew Tom couldn't speak French.
"I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday," said Anne.
Your website looks good.
I know what's up.
Mary is not being careful.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
I saw something.
You knew me, didn't you?
Tom thinks his parents are perfect.
I'm not being unreasonable.
His question took her by surprise.
Tom sold the bracelet.
We haven't had time to do that yet.
Is that too heavy for you?
Every boy and girl knows Columbus.
Come in here a minute.
Can't anyone else come?
I don't understand anything.
Tom and Mary are here, but they're busy at the moment.
Tom is in Australia with me.
She rose slowly to her feet.
Sami stepped back.
I'm sure Tom wants to live with us.
I'm not a doctor.
I do all the work.
We hired a boat by the hour.
Mary hasn't told me where she's planning to stay.
The vaccine has no effect.
Tom and Mary asked me to meet them at the airport.
You're wasting your time trying to convince Tom.
Is Tom the only one who knows how to do that?
Tom thought that Mary had run away.
Do you ever speak French?
Tom's great-grandfather was blind from birth.
Tom will figure out how to do that.
You could feel how the earth trembled.
I'll pay by cheque.
Hooray!
Is any of it dangerous?
Don't worry about the past.
Correct me if I make mistakes, please.
How are you?
Why?
The girl wanted to tell him the truth, but she couldn't.
I know I can count on all of you.
Mary still doesn't do that, does she?
Tom said he was alone.
I can't concentrate if you keep tapping me on the shoulder.
Sami was with somebody else.
They said they were too tired to dance.
Is she going to wait for me there?
Your speech lacked some consistency.
She is my wife.
Aren't you going to write to Tom?
Why haven't you been to Boston lately?
Do you like ravioli?
Mary says she plans to do that.
She likes coffee, doesn't she?
A tree is beautiful, but what's more, it has a right to life; like water, the sun and the stars, it is essential. Life on earth is inconceivable without trees. Forests create climate, climate influences peoples' character, and so on and so forth. There can be neither civilization nor happiness if forests crash down under the axe.
I have climbed Mt. Fuji before.
I was always very close to Sami.
She sold some apples at the market.
He will go to the dentist.
She slipped and hit her head.
Tom seems to know a lot about Boston.
She says she feels the same way.
I just want to disappear.
How do you know Tom did that?
Forget it! It was just an idea.
Your suggestion that we should help Tom is a good one.
You'll start right now.
They looked at their notes.
She's the boss around here.
I saw Tom try to kiss you.
The glass dropped from his hand.
Sami stole from the church.
Tom bought the same camera that Mary has.
How much money do you think people like Tom and Mary spend each month?
Tom said that Mary wasn't good at speaking French.
You aren't needed.
Have you ever been mugged?
The fox changes its fur, but not its vices.
How long do frogs live?
He said that he would not sell the garden.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
When ice melts, it becomes liquid.
I wish I could relax listening to music.
I don't want to end up like her.
Tom said that he didn't want to do that alone.
Somebody has stolen my hair dryer.
Don't talk to your mother that way.
Do you have a match?
Her face turned white at the news.
Mary admitted that she hadn't been honest.
How?
I'm really happy.
I think that I don't deserve it.
Fry the eggs in oil.
You're right, I don't just like the way you said that.
The world could use a lot more people like him.
The Russian man eats turnip only all winter.
Clip your nails.
Tom and I don't plan on traveling together.
Could you please turn the radio on?
Mary trimmed the stems of the flowers Tom gave her so they'd fit into the vase.
I want books to be written about me.
I didn't take that bus, so I'm not at home right now.
Tom had no desire to stay home by himself.
Japan is now very different from what it was twenty years ago.
I can't answer that question.
Tom is very loyal to his friends.
Did you see how close that was?
Please don't open the door.
Don't you think it's wrong to cheat on an examination?
That's good for you.
Tom looks like he's prepared.
There's no hope for you.
You don't eat anything.
The conference starts on Monday.
I saw Tom yesterday morning.
We'll go over it again tomorrow morning.
I need to be ready when Tom and Mary arrive.
Tom has a teenage daughter.
I'd never heard that joke before.
He told me that he was done, too.
If you want to become a good writer, you need to practice writing.
I'm sure Mary is gravely ill.
I hope we'll see you again.
Tom doesn't need to come.
Doctors use medical equipment.
I washed my own shirt.
Walk.
I like the smell of fresh bread.
This coffee is good.
I'm not giving this to you.
The whole nation mourned the hero's death.
This is my dog.
Tom and Mary don't have lawyers.
Quite a few books in my library are in French.
I think that I'm a lucky guy.
I like a lot of money.
I will try.
Please tell Tom to do that at 2:30.
Tom is very young. He's much younger than Mary.
Have you already said hi to Tom?
They've denied they did that.
I don't think that anybody thinks you're crazy.
Mary told me she bought a house in Boston.
What was Tom doing in Boston last month?
Fantastic!
She studies English every day.
I baked Tom some brownies.
Tom deleted all the pictures from his phone.
You just called me fat.
I'm not that old!
I've never met anybody like you.
Mary made her husband's breakfast.
You were the one who did that, weren't you?
The bird is in the sky.
I don't like politics.
What did you do this morning?
Tom and Mary couldn't remember what John had told them.
How much is she paying you?
I think the book is interesting.
Sami felt really uncomfortable.
I want to study German in addition to English.
Maria likes flowers.
I suspect that's not going to happen.
Be serious about studying, or you'll fail the exam.
She's a fisherwoman.
I don't get paid as much as I'd like to be.
Did you write anything in your diary yesterday?
That's where I want to live!
Please close the fridge.
There isn't a moment to spare.
You must work more.
I don't even want to talk to Tom.
She tried to conceal the fact.
The girl is extremely tall.
I don't know why Mary did what she did.
I'm speechless right now.
Don't distract me anymore.
Can you play basketball well?
Tom wasn't very interested.
Don't look at Tom. Look at me.
I want to learn how to say this word in Arabic.
Instead of sitting next to Tom, Mary moved the chair to the other table.
We must make arrangements with them beforehand.
Sami saw Layla's message pop up.
You can identify children's voices without any problem.
This water is polluted, do not drink it.
Don't cry in public.
I've done nothing else.
He's no less than forty years old.
He eats nothing but fruit.
Layla doesn't use lipstick.
I wish to be a doctor.
He said he was going to help.
That's why Tom came.
I'm not really prepared.
I don't have many friends in this town.
It's likely to take more than a week to finish doing this.
I found Mary.
Fadil introduced Layla to Rami.
Mary said she didn't know anything about that.
Please tell him I'm sorry.
I saw you looking.
He wants red glasses.
I have a dog.
Tom praised his son.
You should come too.
I heard the pay is good.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
Tom is trying to get to sleep.
Congrats!
Hurry!
I hope we made the right decision.
Where was Tom hiding?
Wait for us.
Look back!
All you have to do is try your best.
Sami struck Layla in the neck.
Instead of going to Australia, I'm going to New Zealand.
Where did you do that yesterday?
Was Tom really boring?
You should go to a dentist immediately.
Did Tom come here?
Heaving a great sigh I plunk my bread on the table and flump onto the chair.
They took risks.
I don't know where Tom and Mary want to live.
No?
I've been pretty busy.
I don't intend to meet Tom at the airport.
I saw Tom in the hallway.
He translates faster than others read.
Tom and Mary miss their daughter.
She could get here if she wanted to.
500Gb?
Sami told Layla not to touch his belongings.
Tom came to ask us to help him.
Mary knew that Tom loved her.
Breathe!
They saw him throw garbage into forest.
Do all Asians have black hair?
You might need the calculator now.
You'd be perfect for this job.
I come from a small town located in Kabylie, Algeria.
Tom made plans.
I wish you would use yourself to translate, every day, only three or four lines, from any book, in any language, into the correctest and most elegant English that you can think of; you cannot imagine how it will insensibly form your style, and give you an habitual elegancy: it would not take you up a quarter of an hour in a day.
For me, reading at home is preferable to reading sitting beside strangers in a library.
I hate walking.
Don't take it too seriously.
I was freed.
Don't be scared.
You just said that to me?
Tom asked Mary to sell him the guitar she'd inherited from her grandfather.
You'll need some of these.
Can you stop it?
When Tom was four, he had measles.
This bicycle belongs to my brother.
We are driving the trucks into the garage.
Does Tom usually wear a hat?
Tom and Mary don't really know why John wanted them to do that.
Respond.
Tom said that he was going to be very late.
Father gave up cigarettes.
At book sales there are always so many interesting books that I can never afford them all.
I have been waiting for the bus for an hour.
I've already had a cup of coffee.
I'm plowing the soil.
Tom can't forget the time he and Mary had their first big argument.
Mary told Tom that she didn't want to get married until she was thirty.
Goodbye.
Sami is taking pictures.
She can speak English very naturally.
All right.
No thanks, that's not my thing.
Read after me.
Why don't you let Tom know that you aren't going to do that?
Come quick!
You've never studied French, have you?
I know that I won't like living in Boston.
I like to eat nuts.
I wonder how Tom went to Australia.
She sold some apples at the market.
Do you see that happening again?
Tom used to wear a wig.
You look like you just got up.
I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're trying to do.
Tom's real passion is music.
Where did you buy that pen?
Tom is awake.
Therefore?
I'm on the balcony.
Does Tom actually speak French?
Aren't you going to be there?
I thought that Tom was going to win.
See you.
We don't repair PCs here.
Tom counted on Mary's help.
How much time do you spend getting ready for work every day?
Sami won't agree with Layla.
Sami played.
Where did Tom leave his bike?
Dunno.
How many animals do you have at home?
This book contains a lot of beautiful illustrations.
Tom is beginning to cry.
Tom is on the baseball team, isn't he?
Sami didn't understand my message.
Tom can't stop me.
Pick up your things and go away.
Tom put a finger to his lips.
Years passed.
Now I understand it all.
I'm applying for a job.
You will not do it, will you?
Who will eat the apple?
Tom gave a bone to his dog.
One point.
How much money has Tom stolen?
Rabid dogs usually foam at the mouth.
Do you know where my glasses are?
Laurie is twenty years old.
Behold.
You're the only person I know who likes getting up early in the morning.
Tom and Mary said they weren't permitted to do that.
Tom didn't say anything, did he?
Is this the right time?
Why didn't you come earlier?
He says he's rich.
Tom doesn't seem to trust anyone.
Has anything really changed?
Say good things to each other.
Close the door before you go.
Why does Tom want to be a carpenter?
Mary herself might have done that.
Orchids were her favorite flower.
She borrowed my shirt without asking.
Tom needs more practice.
I bought a book.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it'd be.
Tom and Mary usually get what they want.
Tom has no right to give me orders.
Do you like books written by Franz Kafka?
Inhale.
How did Tom die?
Tom and Mary are upset because John has been ignoring them.
Tom and Mary aren't angry.
They say they're prepared to do that.
Everyone was killed.
Mary told me she bought a house in Boston.
The girl is extremely tall.
Death motivates me to live.
I didn't think Tom would tell you how to do that.
She plays the Portuguese guitar.
I can't approve your plan.
Smile.
Tell him you'd like to help.
I don't think that's appropriate.
Divide the pizza among you three.
Unfortunately, you didn't pass the check.
He said that you told him to wait.
I want you to keep away from her.
That was a good guess.
His family adored him and in a sense he was spoiled by them.
Tom didn't seem to be bothered.
Tom looks a lot like his older brother.
No one thinks that way anymore.
I can't say that I like Tom very much.
May fifth is Children's Day.
We must have missed each other.
Somebody has stolen my hair dryer.
We have ambitious plans.
I'm cooking now.
Jump.
The newspaper hasn't published his article yet.
What should I tell him?
Orchids were her favorite flower.
I don't want to live in Australia for more than a year.
Would you like to play tennis every Sunday?
Tom may not make it on time.
I'm doing well, thank you.
What you don't learn from your mother, you will learn from the world.
I sure do miss Tom.
She has twenty children.
Tom and I lost our jobs.
I doubt that I'll be successful this time.
Stars are beautiful.
These are too small for you.
Tom and Mary should probably tell John they're hungry.
Tom is going to help me, isn't he?
You aren't taking that job in Australia, are you?
Tom never killed anybody.
And when Joseph was come in to him, he said: God almighty appeared to me at Luza, which is in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me, and said: I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
I spent the whole day working as a volunteer.
Tom knew me.
Tom took his key out of his pocket and unlocked the door.
Have you ever seen Tom laugh?
She's painting her nails.
You don't need my approval.
Sami started dancing with the teacher.
I have a stomachache.
He usually cries when he's scared.
He said he'd been offered $3,000.
Do I owe you money?
Even though I slept for twelve hours, I'm still sleepy.
Mark is so honest that everyone praises him for it.
Congratulations!
They were together three years.
We're only here to help them.
He wrote her a letter.
Do you promise never to lie again?
Sami is now fifty years old.
He fell in love with one of his students.
Goodbye!
I will not come.
You have to do that before it's too late.
You never told me why you didn't do that.
She knew me.
Mary thought she heard a dog barking.
Quickly!
Tell me what should be done.
Tom came in last in the race.
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston for three years.
You don't want to hang out with people like him.
Kneel!
I can't smoke.
Think!
There's no need to be frightened.
I think that Tom could easily have done that.
I just can't believe Tom and Mary are dead.
Sami was staring at the camera.
You've got something to read.
Do you like apples?
Tom is on his way back home, isn't he?
Sami and Layla were smiling at each other.
He has every reason to quit his job.
Tom came downstairs in his pajamas.
Sami open the book and started reading.
I didn't kill my wife.
When was the last time you voted?
Do you play checkers with your grandmother?
You said you would give me an answer.
Judging by his look, he looks like a beggar.
Tom moved to Boston about three years ago.
I prefer translation to teaching.
Tom has a mustache.
Does Mary understand French?
Tom is going to do that, eventually.
Tom, she's your mother.
A woman is the most sweet thing in the world.
Please put it back where you found it.
I couldn't ask him for money.
Be quiet, all of you.
Nothing happened between us.
I made up my mind to be a doctor.
You're my son.
Eat everything.
Mary said she's already done that.
Do what you want!
And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.
Tom fell asleep right away.
Mary said she's not making much money.
She doesn't actually live in Deal.
Tom has questions, too.
Every student is supposed to know the school regulations.
Do you want a job?
He fries the eggs in oil.
That makes it difficult.
Tom is usually on time for his appointments.
Let's be thankful for everything we have.
Even though Tom is a child, he knows the difference between right and wrong.
I broke one of your mugs.
It would be disappointing if Tom did that.
There was a Brazilian girl in my class last year.
Would it be all right if I don't do that today?
Tom is studying for a test.
Alas.
You take things too much to heart, Anne.
I'm not a very communicative person.
There's a book lying open on the desk.
You sound almost proud of that.
Everything I said was the truth.
Tom told us that the room was locked.
I boldly jumped into the sea.
How many kids named Tom are in your class?
Tom and Mary tried to tell John that they didn't like him.
Sami cannot believe that Layla did this.
I don't love you any less than I do her.
You're the best thing that ever happened.
I can't help eating too much.
Tom and Mary don't realize how lucky they've been.
Tom didn't seem to want to say something.
Tom seemed very interested in doing that.
I'm going to go.
Why is grass green?
Don't you have something else to do?
We arrived at a compromise.
Why do we need to find her?
That's the way things were back then.
Tom woke Mary up.
I haven't even told my wife.
You're supposed to be downstairs.
This university is highly selective.
Mary swore she'd never do that.
Tom asked if he was really required to do that.
If people really landed on the moon half a century ago, why haven't they done it again?
Congrats!
I want to be a doctor or a nurse or a teacher.
I never really was on your side.
Why don't we all go to Boston together?
Tom is anxious to leave, isn't he?
What?
War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.
I am also unemployed.
Mary knew what she was going to do.
Stephen Hawking was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo.
Exactly what happened here?
That's more interesting than I thought it would be.
He is finishing reading the book.
Is that asking so much?
I'm afraid that's no longer possible.
Tom might be terrified.
Be happy!
My sons are soldiers.
I don't think that we can move this piano without some help.
I thought that you liked pancakes.
Please tell Tom and Mary they have to get home before 2:30.
Tom asked Mary if she would dance with him.
I'll be in Australia next week.
Sami is going to like it.
The room was engulfed in darkness.
I felt a sharp pain in the stomach.
Sometimes it's better to keep quiet.
I should go to the city to talk to him.
Tom didn't know that Mary had done that.
Almost all of Tom's ex-wives are friends with Mary.
I know what Tom is like.
Good.
Shouldn't we be helping Tom?
She told me she was a doctor.
Sure!
It is not easy to distinguish good from evil.
You're my star, Sami.
Sami checked Layla's room.
We saw a mouse.
I thought that I had it all.
I'm plastered.
On a clear, dark night, our eyes can see about 6,000 or so stars in the sky.
See you in an hour.
No.
Can you play chess well?
He buttered his toast.
How long do frogs live?
My daughter was not reasonable when I asked her to spend less money.
I'm in Australia right now.
Tom is at home for the whole day.
Can you see yourself marrying him?
He didn't run fast enough to catch the train.
She spreads gossip.
Smoking is banned in restaurants and bars.
Attendance is compulsory for all members.
He didn't think he could do that.
This is something I bought for you.
Dan was responsible for twenty-eight bank robberies.
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary.
Tom will probably wait until 2:30.
The sky has become cloudy.
There's no other way than this now.
I am your fan.
Both Tom and I were here yesterday.
I hope Tom knows who wants to do that.
Tom didn't know who to ask.
Tom and Mary say that they're not angry.
Tom and Mary smiled at the camera.
Anne was at the gate to meet them.
I am all ears.
It's not that scary.
Sometimes it's better to keep quiet.
OK.
He sells shoes.
It is said that she is ill.
I wonder whether it'll snow tomorrow.
I didn't have enough money to buy what Tom wanted.
Were you translating with the help of a dictionary?
Tom never told me how successful you were.
Today is not good for me.
Tom earns more than $10,000 per year.
All students have access to the library.
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment.
Tom is going to tell us about his trip.
She said she didn't agree with you.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to ask John for help.
She studies English every day.
I won't come.
They seldom forget to pay their rent.
You must adapt to a variety of conditions.
Screaming isn't singing.
How are you?
What's not right?
This coffee is good.
Some people think that French is a hard language to learn.
Tom is still a bartender, isn't he?
One point.
Tom agreed not to do that.
Tom and Mary have said that they won't do that again.
I am a teacher.
Tom and Mary lost their keys.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom the truth.
Is it OK if I come in?
She hasn't taken her pills.
Hush!
Louder, please.
Sami left his car keys on the couch.
They say that they aren't going to do that.
She is a British citizen but her native land is France.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
I don't use that kind of language.
Green vegetation is on the decrease on Earth.
I won't be disappointed.
Don't send it to me again.
Maybe we should help her.
Hugs!
We call him Mike.
Three hours should be enough time.
Mary saw a mouse.
She let me stay with her.
I thought Tom would want to help me.
The operation begins at dawn.
Birds fly.
I don't have a shovel, but I know someone who does.
It isn't small but big.
Do you have to read?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know where he's going.
Tom can't come to the phone.
That's what usually happens.
Where did you buy your car from?
I am coming with you.
I asked Tom if he knew anyone who could teach my children French.
We've got a small country, and everyone knows each other.
I'm not sure Tom will do that.
Mary said that she wanted to move to Boston.
Now, listen!
I won't tell them you said that.
The pillow is too hard for sleeping.
It is wet.
He walked towards his car.
Mary is going to cry, isn't she?
Do you know where my glasses are?
It's going to be six dollars because it's international.
I've never forgotten Tom's birthday.
"I like teaching, too," said Gilbert.
Would it be OK if I turned off the lights?
Tom doesn't have the skill to do that.
Tell her where we've gone.
I can't agree with you here.
Layla was Sami's fiancee at the time.
Whoa!
Tom and Mary would never forgive themselves if anything happened to John.
Everyone is counting on us.
Does Tom still work in Australia?
You did that, didn't you?
He would sit for hours reading detective stories.
We simply can't just leave Mary here by herself.
Did you put water in the refrigerator?
Tom is smart enough to answer all the questions.
I hope to see you again in October.
I was in London.
Please sit over there.
The reason that Tom does that for Mary is because he loves her.
Do you listen to classical?
He is older than you by eight years.
It's a cellphone.
This is something I made for you.
What's been stolen?
Nature never breaks her own laws.
Do you understand?
Please answer all the questions.
She told me she likes to swim.
Tom is much closer to his mother than he is to his father.
How do I know this is real?
Dad bought me a few books.
I don't think that Tom will be in Australia next week.
When an earthquake occurs, what will you do first?
I've never seen Tom wearing a tie.
I can't come out and play today.
When did you decide to let Tom do that?
I would give more, but I don't have any left.
You're really brave.
Mary didn't get up this morning as early as she usually does.
I was just reading.
Did you put water in the refrigerator?
Tom said that he didn't do that.
Thanks for waiting.
Do you speak Albanian?
I've decided to tell Mary that I love her.
Would you like to play tennis every Sunday?
I saw you with Tom last Monday.
It happened before.
I teach history.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Where did Tom do that yesterday?
She borrows novels from Tom.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I don't like it when Tom and Mary stay out late at night.
I know that Tom isn't a better driver than Mary.
I don't think it was your fault.
My answer matches yours.
I am living in Volgograd.
It's a few minutes before three o'clock.
When can we see you?
Just follow your heart.
Never!
I've been seen.
I saw Tom stealing something out of your purse.
He's scary.
She speaks both English and French.
I'm learning Turkmen.
Tom and Mary said they don't plan to stay with us this weekend.
Sami doesn't want to meet Layla's dad.
You need to do that no matter how tired you are.
I spend a lot of time studying French.
I denied everything.
Why don't you let Tom know that you aren't going to do that?
She took off her sunglasses.
Do you smell something unusual?
My mouth was full so I couldn't answer.
Are you still doing what you want to do?
He didn't understand Mary's joke.
I don't think Tom's answer is wrong.
Do you know the reason why Tom was late?
I want to sit in your place.
Mary has lots of things she wants to do today.
Sami was the leader of our group.
You should at least tell Tom that you don't want to do that anymore.
This is my bicycle.
Do you go to the same school as Tom?
This is a letter from Canada.
Meanwhile, the weather abruptly changed.
What're Tom and Mary going to do when they finish school?
I won't stop doing it!
You just said that to me?
Plants grow.
Did she write anything in her diary yesterday?
Is the pain unbearable?
Louder.
When will we start taking lessons?
He has to pay for what he did.
Let's ask for it.
I think Tom didn't believe me.
That's not what Tom really needs to do.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't bored.
If you are to succeed, you must make a good start.
Mary asked Tom to give her a ride home.
I'll try her out as a secretary.
Come with us now.
He was such a materialistic person.
You are not answering the question correctly.
Tell her to write me.
Tom and Mary told me they're alone.
I just thought that you might want to talk to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't interested in sports.
This cake is good.
We never should've left early.
When air dries, it makes thirsty and cough.
I saw Tom through the windshield.
I don't think Tom can help you with that.
Tom is almost always cheerful.
Again.
Tom beat me at darts.
Mary introduced her stepson to Tom's stepdaughter.
I think that Tom doesn't really need to do that anymore.
Sami left Layla alone.
We might actually be able to do that.
Try again.
Where did you buy that scarf?
Tom forgot to bring his camera.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
Tom has been living in Australia for a long time.
Mary looked like she was guilty.
I knew that Tom would have enough money.
I'm real careful.
The children are sleeping. Please don't be so noisy.
I'm picking up a tomato.
Mary says she likes horror movies.
Interesting.
These are too small for you.
I love California.
They will not do it.
I don't think Mary knows what she should do yet.
First impressions are important.
She said that she was uncomfortable.
Did you ask Mary why she didn't want to do that?
People mistakenly think that the past was better than the present.
Are you going to go talk to Tom?
Tom knew I was involved.
You didn't know Tom was going to do that, did you?
Isn't that a friend of Tom's?
Sami can't hear anything.
His handwriting is clear.
Tom and Mary need to wait for John.
Boring!
I know all of this is just a game.
Sami was trying to control Layla.
Do you still not understand what's going on?
Thank you!
Did you know that Tom could do that?
There's no hope for you.
Do you go shopping every week?
He brought up the old story again.
I don't need to explain that to Tom.
And who's going to stop us?
It's very interesting.
She stopped teasing me.
Tom was unbeatable.
Shit.
She took risks.
What do you recommend?
Tom and Mary are definitely making progress.
I know what's in your heart.
Mary scared us.
You don't have to come up with an unusual topic for your speech.
Eat!
Mary said she's not making much money.
I have a family.
You might just see Tom, too.
The man who I thought was my friend deceived me.
Sami was respected by everyone.
Wonderful!
They know that I'm older than them.
How wings help birds fly?
You know what this is, don't you?
I'm a teacher.
Words are not created by academies. They are born together with thoughts.
She put her harmonica in her pocket.
Come with all possible speed.
Both Tom and Mary have dyed their hair.
They said they were much happier now.
Hail, Caesar!
This is not a sentence.
Time flies fast.
They quarreled.
Tom couldn't wait until the weekend.
Sami can hear that noise.
Tom and Mary said they didn't believe that really happened.
She wants it.
Patience!
I think you're intelligent.
Sami and Layla traveled to Cairo together.
Tom and Mary wouldn't tell John why they did that.
This one's not working either.
We have to play fair, whether we win or lose.
Write your name in full.
I never wash the dishes unless my mother tells me to.
What are you going to do now?
The entire crew takes pride in its work.
Yes. You always see the smoke before the fire.
Let's talk to him.
Tom and Mary don't eat anything except the vegetables that they grow themselves.
He knows that you know that.
Why do women love presents?
Sami had a mini-crush on Layla.
It isn't easy to get rid of a bad habit.
She needs to change her lifestyle.
If he doesn't write, I will not write him anymore.
What is three times seven?
It's Tom's favorite French word.
I'll do everything I can.
Do what you consider needed.
I know Tom will ask me to do that.
It was a wonderful morning.
She warned you.
I calculated hastily.
He bragged about it.
The man is strong.
She isn't very enthusiastic, is she?
Tom is going to be happy to see you again.
Hey.
What does God have in store for us?
Let's ask for it.
It's beautiful weather, isn't it?
Sorry...
I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
Tom is small for his age.
It's Thursday today.
I'm grateful you volunteered to help.
How can I gain her trust?
We were playing.
It is expected to rain all night tonight.
He's reading.
I think that Tom will call Mary.
You're a very nice person.
There's not a single car on the street.
I've been to Australia more times than Tom has.
Tom teaches at three different schools.
All three of my sisters died in the accident.
I didn't let Tom answer Mary's questions.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think John would let me do that.
They say that the first inclination which an animal has is to protect itself.
Sami made a new friend.
How are you?
We should give Tom a chance to tell us what really happened.
I wrote you ten letters.
Begin!
Quite a few books in my library are in French.
To our surprise, she went to Brazil alone.
Police shouldn't take bribes.
Tom would certainly know how to do that.
I arrived just when Tom and Mary were leaving.
Can we come tomorrow?
Tom asked Mary why she had to do that today.
She speaks only about work.
I had no difficulty in finding his house.
Fly!
I don't know.
Tom doesn't live far away.
I didn't tell Tom and Mary what time they should come tomorrow.
There are islands in the sea.
Mary said she thought Tom would be alone.
I want to sleep.
The office is having a farewell party.
We sell shoes.
Can you play chess well?
The economy of the island is dependent on the fishing industry.
Tom didn't know whether Mary could swim or not.
Tom and Mary admitted that they'd been careless.
Sami isn't posting any pictures on his Instagram.
Tom may be awake now.
Tom can take a break.
I always keep an eye on Tom.
Tom came here to help us fill out these forms.
Oh no!
Are you listening to me?
Tom just got home.
The next station is where you get off.
I already talked to the cops.
I am a student at high school.
None of the books in my library are in French.
How did you find a hair in the soup if I'm bald?
This car belongs to you, doesn't it?
Nothing will ever change that.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Mornin'!
Masaru gets married today.
How much money has Tom stolen?
Sami didn't want anything to happen to Layla.
What do you do?
I think you know that Tom isn't going to be here today.
Tom is never going to permit Mary to do that again.
Please make your bed.
Water temperatures in the Baltic Sea exceeded 23° C in some places.
Tom sang along with the song.
Sami isn't going to say it.
You rewrote it, didn't you?
Mary says she doesn't have time to do that today.
Of how many chemical elements is water composed?
Tom has been on the wanted list for three years.
It was sunny as predicted.
Have you been talking to him?
I have a book.
Mary wouldn't tell anyone, would she?
All of us, except him, went.
You have the same answer to everything.
Listen carefully.
Would you like a seat?
Have you heard the thunder this night?
I didn't have to tell Tom twice what needed to be done.
I hear that he sold his house.
Tom won't be going to Boston with us.
She speaks both English and French.
Aren't you going to the show?
Is it true that you built this house by yourself?
They've seen Tom.
At first sight this problem seems easy, but in fact it's difficult.
Could you please turn the radio on?
Take a look at this report.
I don't know.
I saw you on TV.
His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
Don't be scared.
I knew you'd fail your French test.
Sami is going outside.
Goodbye.
You know that I love all three of you.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be interested.
These are too small for you.
He cut down a tree in his yard.
You should read the introduction at the beginning of the book.
And what we are supposed to do now?
There is every sign of rain.
You need more practice.
Buy!
That's a fascinating question.
I live in Turkmenistan.
Go!
You don't have to sit with Tom.
Please keep your voices down.
Could you spell that?
She looks like she's discontented.
She has her kid with her.
I will endure.
You all know I'm not a criminal.
You didn't believe Tom would ever do that, did you?
