Good morning!
Hello!
Thank you!

Tom refused to give up.

Tom named his dog Cookie.
We are working for you.
Where was this picture taken?
I know that this is important to you.
Nice to know you.

He became accustomed to working in the office.
I still need to talk to you.
I have two cats.
Tom knows this will be difficult.
