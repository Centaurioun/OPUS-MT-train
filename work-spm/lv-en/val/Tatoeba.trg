I hate when other people make me wait a long time.
Hello, Tom.
You can wait here.
Why do we have to go home?
It's your color!
We all need to stay together.
Which do you like better, rock music or classical music?
Maybe it wasn't so obvious.
Merry Christmas!
I dislike coffee.
She's two years younger than me.
Tom has no friends here.
I hope we find it.
Tom pushed Mary off the diving board.
"Where's Tom?" "I don't know. He was here a few minutes ago."
Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?
Do you speak English?
After climbing Mt Fuji I got the inspiration for a poem.
Tom put his bags in the trunk, then hopped in the car and drove off.
I want you to dry my tears.
Where's my tea?
I teach geography.
Mary is a bookworm.
Don't touch me!
I love my city.
Do you love your mother?
Octopus Paul was right.
I prefer comedies.
If you say, "I love you," then I will also say that to you.
What I really want is for Tom to teach me how to play a few chords on my guitar.
I love you and I want to marry you.
I've probably already seen that movie.
Next Thursday is a holiday.
My mother is on a diet.
They're young and healthy.
I'm not your mother.
Hello, world!
Maja Keuc is a good singer.
We became good friends.
If only I was younger.
She made a promise to write to me every week.
Angela is not an angel.
I don't have the option.
I won't eat anything.
I have a stomachache.
He came in and immediately sat down.
Tell me what you find out.
There are some eggs in the box.
Daijisen and Daijirin are very similar.
Please don't talk about Russian potato salad! I'm so hungry.
Sami's daughter is Farid's wife.
I've never hurt Tom.
I wish I could go to Japan.
I won't eat it.
There is a restaurant near here.
I can't believe I actually wanted to marry you.
It's now your turn.
Tom is playing the violin now.
Would you like to dance with me?
One beer, please!
You won't regret it!
How long did you stay?
You should write a book!
After Saturday comes Sunday.
Are you going to eat that piece of pie?
There is a girl in this room.
My TV has quit working.
Tom is dead.
Jack Daniel's is a Tennessee whiskey.
Do you require our help?
I can't answer this question.
I'm sure you can do even better.
But there's a problem.
He awoke me early in the morning.
I didn't quite know what to say.
It's a truly difficult problem to fix.
This watch is waterproof.
And then he sat down himself.
Japan is full of surprises!
How could you be so certain?
The road is long.
A day has twenty-four hours.
He said something.
We often talk about the weather.
He told me to meet him at the restaurant.
I know what Tom likes.
The weather was warm but rainy.
Who loves the son?
Go and say goodbye to him before he leaves.
Tom hung up the phone.
What're you looking for?
I want to live in Brazil.
I hope we'll meet again.
I want to have a sword!
All the apples are there.
Go and see who it is.
I'll set you free.
The fathers are there.
Do we have time?
He died in battle.
I'm glad to see you.
I can't believe he left me for that whore!
The child was hiding behind a big tree.
I was wrong.
That attitude of his is quite disgusting.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
He's a good guy now, so he'll make a good husband in the future.
Tom is my second cousin.
The clock is not working.
See you later!
Were you prepared?
Bob and Tom are brothers.
I'll set you free.
Do you have a plan?
In summer it often rained.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
He looked small next to my heavyset father.
Calm down.
I watch TV every day.
Congratulations!
It's almost noon.
I understand.
That guy got married and started a family.
That man is French. Are you and your sister, too?
We did nothing wrong.
She is busy with the care of her children.
Everybody please calm down.
I wore a hoody.
She has sunglasses.
Would you shut up?
My computer has got to be useful for something.
They picked out the best two works.
Have a nice trip!
How's it going? Are you busy?
The teacher told us a funny story.
