I'd like you to help me.
The young boy is reading his book.
Are you going anywhere?
No matter what happens, I won't be surprised.
How shameful!

Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to produce sentences that sound strange. Please make sure you only translate the sentence if you are sure you know what it means.
I'm on the list.
Whenever they meet, they quarrel.

You can't do two things at once.
Don't you want to know why?
Nobody's perfect.

Layla can't tell.
Why does Tom want all this?
I can hardly walk.
He was very happy.
This car is like new.
Have you ever traveled alone?
Country people are traditionally suspicious of strangers.
America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves, if our children should live to see the next century, if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?
Tom invited Mary to supper.
She is flexible in her opinions.
Why are you alone?
She's Laurie.
Please deal the card.
I think you're wasting your time.
I am busy now.
I want to visit Korea.
Sami slumped over.
He isn't a smoker.
This will take time.
Sami ran.
The letter was signed by Dan.
Tom is your brother.
He bought a dress for her.

"I really need some new clothes," thought Dima.
I have a stomachache.
I suddenly became very sad.
Come on!
Layla heard a loud noise.
We must get Sami to the clinic quickly.
Tom loves Mary, but Mary loves John.
If you see a man approaching you with the obvious intention of doing you good, you should run for your life.
Please introduce me to Tom.
Layla is Fadil's baby girl.
Sami knew he was in danger.
You must gather further information.
Children reflect the family atmosphere.

Have you done your homework?
Sami never feels good.
Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.
Thanks for the advice.
He found my bike.
No one loves war.
Arabic is a simple language.

Layla was dressed in black.
I think I'm right.
Who won?
The young man saved the girl from drowning.
Tom went to Boston with a friend.
I'm pretty sure that Sami can't speak Arabic.
She traveled all over the world.
I'll save you all.

Look at that house.
After listening to an Arabic song for twenty seconds this time - for if he listened for ten this would be a duplicate sentence - Dima finally heard a familiar voice say, "As-Salamu Alaykum!"

Sami quit.
I think that'll happen.
Where's your money?
I am reading your book.
I treated her as my own daughter.
I'll explain this later.
Open that thing!
How are you?
Everybody went to the hospital to see Sami.
I'm not sure what Tom was talking about.
What did I forget to say?

All Tom does is complain.
This book is hard for me to read.
Sami's bus was late.
Come forward.
What's the width of this road?
Are you sure that you want to go there?
She is not tall.
We need that land.
Sami was wrong.
Whatever you say will set her off crying.
It's raining cats and dogs here.
Would you please pay attention?
I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles - principles of justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.
We will reach London before dark.
I'm not trying to deprive you of your rights.
Sami and Layla do spend a lot of time together.
I'll help you, buddy.
Where is your sister?
They didn't give up.

Shut the door.
He must be over sixty.

Don't waste your money by buying things you don't need.
Her name was Agnes then.

Have you ever been to the United States?

Fadil quickly realized that answering that question would be no simple task.
I don't know what it means.
Jack resembles his father.
Have a drink with me.
Let's go as soon as it stops raining.
I'll be happy to teach you things.
Please turn over.
Sami loves Layla so much.
Tom hides some leaked documents.
These texts were written in Hebrew, not in Aramaic.

Look who's talking.
That person doesn't want to do anything.
I don't want to lose you.
Fadil was in fear for his life.
You don't seem to care what happens.
He drinks a glass of water every morning.
You have nothing to fear.
I really wasn't expecting that from you.
Just imitate what he does.
Tell her what he told you.
Sami led a quiet life in Cairo.

What happened to your daughter?
Love songs move me.
Sami posted some videos on YouTube.
I'm not a sentence. I should be deleted from Tatoeba.

Who would like to do that?
Sami is my favorite teacher.

The entire mountain changes color in autumn.
Sami went straight to his computer to chat.
Layla headed back to Cairo.
What's happening here?
I wanted to get you some clothes for the winter.
I see that you properly understood Kafka, maybe even better than he understood himself.
What's all the noise about?
I saw flashing red lights in my rear-view mirror and my heart sank.
I don't doubt his ability to do it.
Sami hates Farid.
You are Berber.
The Niagara Falls are famous as a world leading tourist resort.

For that reason, he lost his job.

We'll find a solution, I'm sure.
He works in the car industry.
I would love to write hundreds of sentences on Tatoeba, but I've got things to do.

Brush your teeth.
I dipped into his book.

"Is he coming?" "No, I don't think so."
I believe that there are other ways.
Sami and Layla went camping.
The book was checked out from our local library.

What's your impression of the United States?
Sami led a crazy life.

Finally, it's Friday.
Those who forget everything are happy.
We all make mistakes.
Close the door, please.
What made you come here?
Where are you getting the money from?
Sami admitted guilt.
What made them mad?
Speaking English isn't easy.
She's a quiet person.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm sure you're mistaken.
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
We weren't friends.
The book is easy.

Let's forget about this.
I'm ready! Can we go?
I want a book to read.
I bought a few stamps.
Police searched Fadil's house.
Why don't you try to fix it?
Her father can afford to give her a big allowance every month.

Women and children first!
I don't understand this question at all.
The bus hasn't come yet.
He died without having made a will.
Why didn't you just say that before?
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
I'm at a loss for words.
I want to be a doctor.
Maybe Tom likes you.
Many students took part in the contest.
This is a school.

It is foolish to take his word seriously.
Can you suggest a better idea?

I went back to Algeria.
We need rain.
Take Tom upstairs.
Although Iran is nowadays known for being a stronghold of Shia Islam, most Persian Muslims were Sunni until the XVth century.

May I use your telephone?
I knew you'd come.
Have the tourists all gone on board?
I missed you so much!
Layla got Fadil's special attention.
His letters become less significant.
I'll make you happy.
Tell me who you were talking about.
Will you marry me?
Sami was a young and impressionable teenager back then.
Turn on the light, please.
I think that Sami has got time to spend in jail.
You should sleep.
A good idea occurred to me.
Sami contacted Layla.
You will go. You will return. Never in war will you perish.
Sami likes it here.
Many young men tend to commit the same errors.
The others will arrive in a few minutes.
Today, Layla's life is good.
Tom told me all about what had happened.
Did he tell you that he would fire Fadil?
Sami liked to party.
They hated Tom.
They forced her to confess.
I'd like to see her.
Would you stop, please?
As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith.
Fadil poisoned Layla's food.
These containers are airtight.
Where are you going, Dad?
Fadil was rushed to the hospital.
This book isn't worth reading.
You're in better shape than I am.
Sami gave a prayer rug to Fadil.
What are you going to do tonight?
Layla visited Sami in Cairo.
Sami is out of options.
What makes you laugh like that?
Never worry.
I take light exercise every morning.
He was wounded in the shoulder.
Fadil is alone again.
He lost two sons in the war.
I didn't know that.
Do as you want.
You must build up your courage.
Sami knew he wasn't supposed to ask his patient on a date, but couldn't resist the Egyptian beauty.

Please don't mind him.
English is an international language.
I will be busy tomorrow.
I suppose you're hungry.
I'm not paranoid, they do follow me!

I'm not happy with it.
Tell Tom to pick up the phone.
You must learn from your mistakes.

The play begins at 2 p.m.
"What time is it now?" "It's ten o'clock."
The sea is calm.
"I don't know," said Tony.
I went to many shops to look for the book.
This book has a lot of useful Berber words.
What are you thinking about now?
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I'm proud of myself.
I thought the game was over.
He can't handle the truth.
The police began to go into the murder case.
Sami was punched in the mouth.
I don't want to talk to you, because you broke my heart.
It's too hot.
She used to be a very shy girl.
Keep the picture.
Will I get to the station if I take this road?

She refused his offer.
I'm left-handed.
Don't forget your coat!
I'll miss you so much.
But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire.

I ate an insect by accident.
I can't take the heat.
It's time to go to bed.
Can I go swimming, Mother?
Layla had thirty minutes to arrive there.
Fadil was a classic manipulator.
What would I do without you?
You must study hard.
Tom died yesterday.
He was silent all the time.
Please open your suitcase.
Sami turned to alcohol and narcotics to stop the pain.
I have a pain in my shoulders.
Sami received a number of letters from Layla.
I've looked everywhere.
This is my house.
He slept at ten o'clock yesterday.
Move now.
Sami had lunch.
Wake up!
Both Tom and I are very busy.
I am telling you the truth.
Sami is sitting in jail.
There were a lot of birds in the tree.
It's hot today.
This is too big.
I've got to speak to Tom.
Ah, when will they meet again?

English is a sister language of German.
The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is "What does a woman want?"
This is not my car.
Find a good job.
Tom is very talkative.
That is his car.
Gaza is the world's largest open-air prison.

Where does your uncle live?
Bob can cook.
The teacher tripped over the cord.
If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago.
What's that tall building?
What's the purpose of your trip?
Sami exploded.
He seldom, if ever, laughs.
I often catch colds.
I want to learn English.
Sami is gonna be spending most of his life in prison.
He is getting better day by day.

Promise me you won't get mad if I tell you.
I'm old enough to drink.
Sami shut the door.
Sami likes you.
I already told them.
I skip ads on videos whenever I can.

I don't pretend to understand women.
It is unfortunately true.
What happened to my computer?
This is my office.
Layla is a hijab stylist.
Tom is not home.
He attempted to escape.
I am not a pessimist.
My name is Emily.
The ship was at the mercy of the waves.
Do not forget!
Layla killed Sami to save her life.
Why are you memorizing this poem?
The rain has stopped.
Tom likes painting pictures.
What's the meaning of this word?
He was killed.
Tom can't let go of the past.
No, thanks. I am tired.
Layla killed Sami over money.
I've been here before.
I like sport.
So?
Sami took over the finances.
I remember mailing the letter.
I've already given Tom his birthday present.
Many couples end in divorce.
Ladies first.
Sami hit his wife.
I am so exhausted!
It's the wrong way to do it.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
No one believed me at first.
The teacher of that class was a Muslim convert.
I know his name.
Please get out of the car.
After listening to an Arabic song for ten seconds, Dima finally heard a familiar voice say, "As-Salamu Alaykum!"
Hard work never killed anyone. But why take the risk?!
How's the project going?
Fadil was a neglectful father.
There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair.
Thanks for bringing the washing in, Gerry.
Sami and Layla began spending more time together.
Sami had a love for danger and a need for speed.
Have a blessed Mid-Sha'ban.
He told us an interesting story.
Sami has finally finished doing that.
Fadil sounded remorseful.
Sami rode the same bus as Layla.
We have only scratched the surface of Sami's story.
She talks a lot.
Sami was placed in a psychiatric hospital.
Your watch has been found.
Sami dominated the people around him.
It's lunch time.
Where does Tom live?
Jack suddenly stopped talking when Mary entered the room.
Get out of my life. I detest you.
Layla has probably run off again.
Let's go somewhere else.
I passed my Berber test.
Do you have a website?
Sami was probably dying.
Mary was proud of her beauty.
I learn a lot from Berber kids books.
I'm sorry.
Sami is walking.
The steeple of the cathedral of Seville used to be a minaret.
I got on the wrong bus.
I am a cat. I don't have a name yet.
Sami and Layla weren't related.
You really exaggerate returning at this time.
It started raining.
He is burning with anger.
Prices are high these days.
This teacher is amazing.
Sami wasn't going to survive anyways.
Go home quickly.
Wipe your nose.
Don't pick your nose!
I am going to study.
Sami replied.
She's a devout Catholic.
He doesn't live in my neighborhood.
Sami got a strange call from someone whose voice he didn't recognize.
I work every day except Sunday.
I didn't want to disappoint Sami.
Does anyone speak English?
Her garden is a work of art.
He got up at eight in the morning.
She has long feet.
The word downtown refers to the business quarter of any town.
I think he won't come.
Don't depend on your parents too much.
Sami was having an affair with a married woman.
Sami is still single.
It feels like a dream.
Sami and Layla were involved in an accident.
Sami came to the mosque before the adhan.
Tom studied geology.
The police started to think that Fadil may have had some unlikely enemies in the area.
Why didn't you tell me there was a meeting today?
It's very important to get enough rest.
Layla drives as if she owned the road.
You people go ahead. We'll bring up the rear.
I don't know whether he was honest or not.
Has Tom been indicted?
Pray forgive me!
It's nearly three o'clock.
I wasn't expecting this to happen.
He knows that I love him.
She's so young.
What do you recommend?
Maybe Tom can do something to help.
The girl was afraid of her own shadow.
Can you lend me some money?
Sami was living his best life.
Don't worry, cutting your hair doesn't hurt.
His clothes are out of fashion.
When did you ask Tom?
First responders tendered to Sami's injuries.
Layla came home at night.
School begins at eight-thirty.
Did it snow yesterday?
Avi Shlaim's first language is Arabic, and Hebrew is his second language.
Layla was thirsty.
How could they forget?
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
One day I met him.
How is everyone?
Do you have a larger size?
I met a friend of mine at the airport.
Cut your coat according to your cloth.
When and where shall we meet?
Sami missed Layla.
The sky is clear.
Don't forget to clock out before you leave work.
I don't like it, either.
The watch broke down.
Tom definitely had enough time to get the job done.
You understand me.
Fadil started transfering Layla's house into his name.
Women should have their faces visible.
That's how I grew up.
I think you're dumb.
You have to help her, but quickly.
Have you finished reading that novel?
In the tourist season, many hotels raise prices.
What did you do with that camera?
Walk as fast as possible.
How do you do, Mrs. Jones?
Fadil was Rami's new associate.
He wrote "Best regards" at the end of the letter and then went on to sign his name.
I see it rarely.
Electricity is very useful.
I need a Japanese-English dictionary.
Sami told Layla about his life.
I don't blame you.
I need to study.
She is getting prettier and prettier.
Why did he remain in Germany?
Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur.
You have reached your destination.
Sami found a professional camera on the beach.
I will transfer the money.
We came dangerously close to freezing to death.
By signing the contract, I committed myself to working there for another five years.
Let's have a try.
Fadil was interested in horses.
Clean your room.
He looks strong.
You should talk to them.
Sami started taking my clothes off.
They asked for help.
English has become my favourite subject.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
Both of them are in the room.
The child's face glowed when he saw Santa Claus.
I haven't eaten anything for days.
He filled the cup to the brim.
Someone is watching you.
It's time for me to go.
Success does not come from laziness.
Sami led an immoral life.
He's better than me in everything.
Why did you quit?
I hate chemistry.
As usual, Mike was late for the meeting this afternoon.
Sami confronted Layla.
She is the laziest person I know.
He faces many obstacles.
I wanted to go there.
We are facing a violent crisis.
Sami went to the mosque on Friday.
I like candlelight.
The song reminds me of my young days.
Sami was screaming and yelling and punching the wall.
Layla might get pregnant.
I got my teacher fired.
Sami was coming from that coffee shop.
You'll forget about me someday.
You are really annoying.
How did a total stranger know his name?
Peter is buying a tomcat.
This never happened in my adult life.
I just finished work.
He couldn't run very fast.
What were we talking about?
Tom didn't want to get married again.
Are you all ready?
I'm very happy now.
As if I didn't know that!
What should I do?
They already have three cats, they don't need another one.
Sami wants to spend some time alone.
My sister sometimes makes our dinner.
Alright.
What does your daughter look like?
This is the only alternative.
Why do you want to buy this book?
Hello!
Sami had another woman in his life.
Does Tom want to come?
People love to talk - talk - talk.
We sell orange juice.
He told me not to drive too fast.
Violence against women is one of the most frequent violations of human rights worldwide.
Hunger urged him to steal.
Stand up!
Tom is wearing a sports coat.
The lake is deep here.
Do you want to dance with me?
I take my camera with me wherever I go.
How long did you wait for me?
I told her that you're a nice girl.
Please help yourself.
He took a notebook out.
Sami tried to describe what happened.
Sami took classes.
Sami went left.
Kabylie is part of Algeria and will always be.
He is angry with you.
Can you help me with my work?
He was jealous.
Sami was really smart.
I have my own job.
Sami ran outside.
Nobody cares for me.
We dipped pieces of fruit in melted chocolate, and put them in the fridge to harden.
I didn't go to school.
Bottoms up!
The nurse gave me a shot.
Teachers gave up on Sami.
It's very good.
It's an indisputable matter.
Do you know me? - No, I don't.
We're eating apples.
Sami can win.
He was obviously in pain.
We talked until two in the morning.
Sami is not just a doctor, but a surgeon.
You wash the dishes, Ben.
You cheating bitch.
One event followed another.
We've just finished breakfast.
Don't forget to lock up when you leave.
Sami lived a glittering life.
He sleeps like a baby.
I'm not leaving this police station until I see Sami.
Where did you see the boy?
Do you own a computer?
Ken kept on singing that song.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Why are you all afraid of Sami?
Sami was living his life.
Am I your friend?
Get him!
Don't cry over spilled milk.
I don't know.
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
Some children play video games all the time.
Your house is three times as large as mine.
I've shut all six windows.
You're quite right.
You must get ready quickly.
You are a good student.
Layla notified police.
Sami tried to wave his arm.
I met him on several occasions.
I have lived here since 1990.
The floor was covered with blood.
Sami was just waiting.
Do you want to go out for a drink?
Sami needed money.
Sami could have protected Layla.
The initial interrogation took place at a police station in Toronto.
To Fadil, Arabic was not only new, but very complicated.
I started learning Chinese last week.
He likes oranges.
Sami drank.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
Why on earth did he do that?
I have to take medicine.
The girls just want to have fun.
Have you got change?
There is no hope of his recovery.
You talk as if you were the boss.
Sami took his shahada last week.
I have another good idea.
I read a book while eating.
It was their fault.
One hundred is my favorite number.
Our cat is very fond of seaweed.
"Where are you?" "I'm here!"
What is the problem?
Sami's car wasn't starting.
Don't look at her!
You should keep your promise.
Everybody laughed at me.
Do you know who I am?
Where are we going?
I have been learning Berber for years.
Betty was the first girl who came to the party.
You will miss the train.
Sami came to the bus stop to pick Layla up.
There was love and respect.
I went home.
Please do not forget capital letters.
Tom spent the entire afternoon with Mary.
Can we trust you?
Have faith.
Shouldn't we ask Tom?
I hope to see you again.
Sami explained everything.
Go back to your house.
A door must be either shut or open.
Sami seemed nice.
It turned out that I was right.
Cops can't question him because of that.
Sami and Layla had a class together.
Are you hungry?
I'd like to do it with you.
We want to know why.
Mennad scheduled an appointment for himself.
Look at that red building.
This conversation is going to be recorded.
The police have Tom under surveillance.
Do you think I am nuts?
She plays World of Warcraft.
Tom slowly opened his eyes, and then Mary kissed him.
Sami showed Layla the money.
Layla preferred to spend her time out of the house.
It happened on the first of May.
What's the average rental for a shop here?
It's news to me.
That man has a foul mouth.
Layla looked out the window and saw Sami's car.
We were late because of the storm.
Layla played into Sami's loneliness and seduced him.
I was wrong.
That is a new story to me.
Will you help me with my homework?
You didn't understand.
We stood face to face.
Sami taught Layla how to swim.
I hope you enjoy it.
Sami was drunk.
You must pay attention when swimming in the sea.
Sami has swallowed dozens of pills and a bottle of tequila.
So where's the fire?
The clinic director is Sami.
I haven't washed my hair.
Sami called Layla from the neighbors' home.
You look like you've been doing something you shouldn't.
Islam is not only a religion. It's a way of life.
Everyone knew Sami's family.
Sami's little sister passed away when she was just six.
Is there anyone who can pronounce this word?
We have to expect the worst.
Can I help you somehow?
Fadil said he heard voices in his head.
We are at home.
Does it bother you if I smoke?
I can't lie.
If I can't have Fadil, no one else is going to have him either.
I have to go now.
I want to answer the last question first.
This one is Fadil.
Doctors declared Layla's cancer in remission.
Sami took Layla's car keys and left.
You should've seen the picture.
You'd better not eat too much.
As long as we live, we have to work.
Sami lay in a coma.
Sami went straight to his father's house.
I would like you to meet my parents.
He lived a long life.
I've borrowed a car.
My sister made me a beautiful doll.
Aydar is a Kazakhstani citizen.
I'll give you a lesson that you'll remember for a long while.
Bob and Tom are brothers.
It's cold this morning.
I lost my wife in a traffic accident.
Hear and see and be still.
She practiced her English pronunciation yesterday.
Layla was sound asleep.
Sami dragged Layla by her hair.
Sami apologized.
I've lost my bag.
I don't have any brothers.
Can you eat raw oysters?
My students are always studying.
Please boil the eggs just a little so that even the whites are not quite hard.
I forgot to write the address on the envelope.
Why do you believe that all Muslims are terrorists?
Sami invited Layla back for an even bigger discount.
His health has begun to decline now.
Let's make a trade.
Layla wanted to win Sami back.
Sami's crime stunned all the community.
He loved her, and she loved him, too.
Sami is extremely shy.
Sami was fired.
Then he lay on the same bed.
This tie doesn't go with my suit.
He isn't afraid of death.
You should turn off the light before going to sleep.
Where is your school?
Why did you go to Tokyo?
My mother is making a cake for my father.
You can go if you want.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
This manga is pretty popular in China.
She doesn't know where to look for him.
Can somebody help me?
Fadil was 600 miles away, driving to Cairo on the night Layla went missing. This means there's no way that he could have been the killer.
We want to get to know Tom.
Sami probably spent the weekend with his new girlfriend.
Coud I have some water? My throat is really dry.
Aren't you forgetting one thing?
He continued walking for some time.
Who wrote this book?
The conference ended two hours ago.
Sami didn't take a shower.
Where did you buy that dress?
Layla and Sami wanted to spend a perfect day.
Sami exposed Layla on YouTube.
I left him in charge.
May I hold your hand?
He is a VIP and we must treat him as such.
We have never seen a suicide that looked like this.
Only a few people understood me.
I am certain that he will quit his job.
This table is reserved.
These letters are from Sami's parents.
I remember seeing her before.
Sami still misses Layla.
Fadil was waiting for Layla to come in.
Is there anything that you want to tell me?
I left a note by your door this morning.
Where is she?
This man has a horse.
Sami really needed to see a doctor.
This lesson should be kept in mind.
Will you give me a light?
Where is his clinic located?
Sami heard an inner voice.
Forget me.
Let her go.
No one was present.
Sami's death put the community into a panic.
I am studying Persian.
Is that your mom?
Sami has mysteriously gone missing.
Sami was given a life sentence.
They're with me.
Sami was sitting on the bed.
Fadil rushed Layla to the hospital.
Honey is made by honey bees.
"Noobs," Al-Sayib stated. "If 25 people got killed by you, Dima, then they must have been noobs."
Stop teasing your brother!
Sami continued to talk.
There are seven days in a week.
I'm so happy.
That's what I thought.
We had to dip into our savings in order to pay the unexpected medical expenses.
If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
I looked for my cup, but didn't find it.
When will you be back?
Be yourself!
I am pleased to see you.
You're just running away from life's problems.
He lost his father at sea.
He opposes this initiative.
Don't forget these.
Here comes the bus.
He's not stupid.
This question isn't easy.
My brother is now in Australia.
Doing that would be dangerous.
My brother is small but strong.
Everett spoke for almost two hours.
Please speak to me in English.
Let's try something.
When did you get to London?
Tom died.
For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere.
She listened to him.
I am translating an article.
Sami felt resentlful.
I was caught in a traffic jam.
I have to find someone to help me.
Whom are you speaking of?
This watch is expensive.
The conquest of Ä°stanbul antedates the discovery of America.
I know I'm in trouble now.
Nothing happens unless it is preceded by a dream.
Not every lamp is magic.
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
You had better not eat too much.
Mary warned you.
I'm looking forward to our ski trip.
She attempted to kill herself.
Such pretty flowers!
Sami liked kids.
My father always speaks in a very loud voice.
I think that the investigators are barking up the wrong tree.
Darwin changed the world.
Have you ever been to America?
Layla lived in a neighborhood where people couldn't come out of their homes.
Their job is to cut up the wood.
I like foreign languages.
Dark is the best German series.
Some Arabs are Christians.
There is nothing like a glass of beer after a whole day's work.
She likes the rain.
I woke up at five this morning.
A computer is a complex machine.
Sami's job isn't making him happy.
Our clinic is the leader in this sector.
My tie is orange.
Milk doesn't mix with water.
Sami visited the hospital.
Maybe Tom has something to hide.
How did Tom know where Mary was?
Call a doctor immediately.
Science is not fantasy.
Pus has formed in the wound.
I will never forget her answer.
Sami probably tried to rape Layla.
My father and mother were sitting under a tree.
Dan told his daughter Linda that he would cut her off financially if she married Matt.
Sami missed his dog.
Sami asked me questions.
This book is unique in many ways.
Law and politics are two different things.
I'm going to have you read the letter to me, Tom.
"Just where are you, Dima?!" Al-Sayib asked, getting a towel to wipe the spilled Fanta.
It will probably snow tomorrow.
It's about a ten-minute drive from here.
He lost his job.
He doesn't smoke.
Muslims believe that Jesus was one of God's messengers.
This woman is my wife.
Layla was still missing.
May I introduce my friend to you?
My brother skips school often.
I'm thirsty.
Please tell me how I can get in touch with her.
Just stand there, please.
Which one do you take?
Mark Twain said, "All generalizations are false, including this one."
She still loves you.
Layla realized what was happening.
What happened last night?
Why do you want to leave today?
It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long, by so many, to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve, to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.
Today it's very sunny, so everyone is wearing sunglasses.
Sami slapped Layla.
It's something I'll never forget.
I am happy.
I'm in love with you and I want to marry you.
My friends invited me to dinner.
She tried not to look disappointed.
Let's start with Lesson Ten.
Please wait outside the house.
Sami took Layla to the health center.
Why do you think you have to do that?
My uncle gave me his car.
She stayed in the house all day.
It is rude to speak with your mouth full.
I'm here as a friend.
Tom never thinks about others.
What did Tom make?
I just cried because all the others did.
We can't sleep because of the noise.
Do you love each other very much?
His boss is friendly, he's American.
Will you go to America next month?
Layla found another man.
I tell you the truth.
Could you give me a hand in the kitchen, please?
You need to stop smoking.
Mother is cooking in the kitchen.
Sami's family demanded justice for him.
Just forget it.
From these verses, we can see the different description of the same entity: the city, the kingdom, the heavenly Jerusalem, the church, and Mount Zion.
Where do you play tennis?
That's my dictionary.
Did he come by bus or by train?
Some were late.
My finger turned brown after I dipped it in a slightly concentrated solution of potassium permanganate.
Are you sure you know how to do this?
Sami has just started life.
Tom's house is very small.
She is used to staying up late.
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
There's no one home.
This apple tastes sour.
Sami told us a crazy story.
The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we WILL get there.
Bread is made from wheat.
I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
I'm ready.
He drowned in the river.
You are forgiven.
Don't forget that Layla is also my niece.
The woman I saw there wasn't the woman I knew.
She is almost as tall as you.
I brought what she asked me to get.
Sami overpowered his assailant and killed him.
Layla charmed her way into a job.
Fadil was brought to justice.
Do you want some pepper?
Fadil had the same mindframe at that time as Dania.
They were listening to the radio.
This is a book.
Let's get started right away.
Sami told police where Layla exactly lived.
Sometimes I wonder if this world is just in someone's head, and he dreams us all into existence. Perhaps it's even me.
It's an old piano.
Your baby can walk.
There are some boys in the park.
So we love sentences. But, even more, we love languages.
Sami responded.
It is sunny today.
He likes to travel by himself.
Mary ran.
Atlantis was destroyed.
Gboard supports the Berber keyboard.
This is how we've got to know each other.
Sami grew up on country music.
This event benefits no one.
Sami smoked.
Sami told Layla to go to the hospital.
Layla was hiding in a boat.
Without a goodnight kiss I won't have sweet dreams.
This girl was always good and dutiful.
I have a gay neighbor.
He introduced his sister to me.
I don't know him.
You're a beautiful girl.
Fadil brought Layla home.
You must follow school rules.
The city was destroyed by fire.
Sami knows Layla is angry with him.
It gives me nausea too.
Let's forget about this.
Get me a chair, please.
Sami paid for this out of his pocket.
Do you really think that Tom won't come?
Sami became lost and confused.
The room was so full of smoke that I could hardly breathe.
When I try to listen to music with media player there's an error and I can't play the file.
Tom never did regain his memory after the accident.
Don't forget to put it on your schedule.
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
You didn't look surprised.
Goodbye to you.
Do you mind if I open the window?
Sami gave Layla a hug.
Jamal waited for you all afternoon.
Did you go to the shop?
Sami was taken to the municipal clinic.
Sami looks like you.
The investigation stalled.
He would tell me the truth, if I would ask him.
Algeria is the largest country in Africa.
Criticizing Zionism doesn't mean that you're criticizing the Jewish religion.
Try it again.
It's up to you.
I was busy yesterday.
I like him because he is honest.
The jagged mountains were capped with snow.
Are you getting me?
You shouldn't leave the baby alone.
Police suspected Sami had been living a double life.
I caused this.
Anna has chestnut brown hair, but Magdalena has blonde hair.
Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
Are there many tourists in Armenia?
Muslims believe in Jesus and Muhammad.
Caution: wet floor
I have no idea where she lives.
You should apologize.
The sisters are both blondes.
What's wrong with what we did?
He is a counterfeiter.
Sami literally knew no one at the party.
The young doctor devoted himself to helping the poor and sick.
At first he had trouble getting used to his new house.
Sami will be right back.
Don't worry, everything will be OK.
Saturday is a great day.
You're working too hard. Take it easy for a while.
He attempted to escape.
Sami was inhaling alcohol.
I need you to trust me.
I'm about ready.
I have a stomachache.
That house belongs to him.
Let's watch a movie.
Some young women are attracted to gang members because it looks exciting to them.
Then there is a problem...
She bought two pounds of butter.
Yes, that happens from time to time.
The police didn't find any clues.
Don't run, walk slowly.
Get up!
Sami stayed with friends.
It's really bothering me.
I must go now.
Tom dipped a strawberry in chocolate and then put it in his mouth.
School starts in September in Europe.
There were hundreds of ticks in its fur.
Alice wasn't present at the meeting, was she?
Fadil didn't have much knowledge about Islam back then.
He was foolish enough to believe what she said.
Sami didn't want to be friendly with us.
He continued his work after a short break.
Tom is all alone again.
He reddened like a schoolboy.
It seems to me that you are honest.
My mother hates writing letters.
Sales are down now.
Take a rest.
You will be released.
That fighter plane dropped a bomb.
Sami believed that Islam was a religion of terror.
I won't move.
Why did you break up with your last boyfriend?
Anything you say can be used against you in court.
They live in the same state.
I'm very proud of my father.
"Maybe you're right." "Of course I am."
The police had reasons to suspect Sami.
Japan is poor in natural resources.
What's your job?
What did you do?
Sami has taken his pills.
Education is learning what you didn't even know you didn't know.
What if he fails?
I'm not a tourist.
He told us a story about a boy named Tom Sawyer.
His dad calls him Tom.
I am a Muslim.
That was years ago.
He's not breaking the law.
Mary seems to be bored with the game.
Fadil had a Muslim girlfriend.
Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.
Dania was raped and tortured.
He will come soon.
Tom expected this to happen.
Layla wore a black dress.
Tom waited a long time for Mary, but she never showed up.
Admittance to staff members only.
He wrote a letter.
You aren't busy, are you?
Sami agreed to watch Layla's place during the weekend.
Tom traveled a lot last year.
I met an old man near the station.
I studied for one hour.
Calm down.
There is one apple on the desk.
Don't forget to think before speaking.
Will you go with Tom?
That incident changed Sami's life.
It took a national TV campaign to finally track Fadil down.
I'll find him for you.
I'm still trying to play guitar like Eric Clapton.
Sami could make friends with a fucking rock.
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.
Sami didn't know who was stalking him.
She tried to stifle a sneeze during the concert but she couldn't hold it back.
Sami was happy with his life.
Sami forgot the word.
This doesn't concern me.
"Drinking Fanta and telling noobs to shut up," Al-Sayib replied, taking a sip of the aforementioned Fanta. "Wait, who is this?"
Why don't you get a real job?
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
Never lose faith in yourself. You can do everything you want to do.
I'm going to drive to a Japanese restaurant.
Of course.
You should apologize to her.
"You're changing the subject." "What was the subject?"

I can't.
I'm not interested in doing that.
He lost his reason when he saw his house burn down.
I'm looking forward to spending time with my family.
This is our art teacher.
Parents don't always know who their kids are spending time with.
Sami started punching and kicking Layla in the stomach.
Why did you ask me?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Sami took the shahada in the mosque.
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
Dreams came true.
We don't know him.
It is so nice of you to give me a present.
Where did you buy that coat?
A popular, capacious theatre in the city tempted many a moviegoer on a hot, sunny afternoon.

We couldn't figure out what Paul wanted to do.
Did you tell Sarah?
Can you come?

He filled the bottle with water.
What are you trying to do? Drive me insane?
What's your hobby?
Sami was serving a life sentence.
Police had reasons to suspect Sami.
You're always criticizing me!
This is a fundamental question.
I'll be playing tennis with Tom this afternoon, but it's not something I'm really looking forward to.

Sami was digging holes in his backyard.

Layla's bank accounts were frozen.
Fadil fell in love with Arabic right away.
I am also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alaykum.
Sami needs to eat.
Fadil portrayed himself as a wealthy man but he lived in the basement of his parents' house.
How can we ask for humans to respect nature, the planet and the animals if respect between them does not exist?
She's way taller than me.
Here is your change.
This watch is superior to that one.
Muslims don't play music at the mosque.
Layla left Sami fot another man.
That was an evil bunny.

The rain has let up, so we can begin.
Sami's life isn't your problem.
Who's the boss of this company?
Give me your book.
Be tolerant.
Do you really think Tom will do that?
We won't approach the enemy.
Why is Fadil here?
There's no air in this room.
She suggested that we go to the theater.
She may not come here tomorrow.
They didn't run.
Put on your cap.
For how long are you in Shanghai?
Watch out! A car is coming!
He'll be there in ten minutes.
I know this sounds a little bit crazy, but I'm not the person you think I am. My true name is Sami Bakir and I'm wanted for murder.
Tom couldn't hold back his tears.
I don't wanna think about him.
My hobby is visiting old temples.
This road leads to the public hall.
He has, say, fifty thousand yen.
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
The doctor told Layla that she couldn't have children.
It's not what you think!
Layla wanted to continue to prove that she loved her man.
Would you like to be my new friend?
Sami thought that Layla loved him unconditionally.
How is everybody?
She had suffered a heart attack.
Sami has to take his medication.
