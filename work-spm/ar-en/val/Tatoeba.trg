He just wants to have fun.
I must help her.
That's about all.
What do people do for fun in Boston?
Sami was getting married.
Sami isn't friends with Layla anymore.
"Come and see," said Philip.
Tom ate Mary's sandwich.
Sami had a very deep voice.
Tom is too drunk.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm an engineer.
I don't want to see him at all.
Don't be embarrassed, Jamal.
Sami told that to a nurse.
We have to get him to the hospital before it's too late.
It is all the same for me.
Sami is being treated for mental illness.
Sami answers the phone.
That very tune reminded me of my adolescence.
Muslims pray to God.
Sami is friends with Farid.
Do you like apples?
His lecture started on time.
Sami seemed upset.
Who are those girls?
Fadil endangered Layla's life.
Fadil will have his money.
Don't change because of someone. Be yourself and the right one will like you as you are.
Fadil studied Islam.
We can rest after lunch.
Whose books are those?
Layla wanted to protect Sami.
What time will the flight arrive in Tokyo?
He reached for the apple.
We have to start somewhere.
Layla escaped a jail term.
He pointed out that the plan would cost a lot of money.
Don't listen to him, he's talking nonsense.
Tom got into a fight with Mary's brother and got his nose broken.
Sami's car was parked in Layla's driveway.
Sami had to spend some time in jail.
She's singing in Berber.
He does not run.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
The skies are clear.
Sami has to wait for Layla.
If you think education is expensive, wait till you see what ignorance costs you.
Did you practice the piano this morning?
There is no such thing, at this stage of the world's history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.
I thought you might want to come along.
I'm neither rich nor famous.
I don't give a fuck about what you say!
Tom got into a fight with Mary's brother and broke his nose.
I wanted red shoes.
People wondered why Sami spoke in Arabic.
Aren't you in love with me anymore?
The sun is rising now.
He will not be ready.
Can you speak English?
Sami became a dangerous fanatic.
What's on the air now?
All of my friends like soccer.
Sami struggled to accept Layla's death.
There are many factors.
What time is it, anyway?
When the whistle blows, that means everyone stops what they're doing and listens.
The Palestinian Authority should go.
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Go back to your seat.
Where is my key?
Sami wanted to read the letter.
Sami was the top of his class.
I can't think of his name just now.
Many kinds of animals have vanished from the earth.
Rabbits have long ears.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
Tom smiled.
On your mark, ready, set, go!
I will make some coffee.
Who's sleeping here?
Sami wrote Layla a lot of letters.
You have foul breath.
We heard it from Mr Such and such.
Sami trying to kill himself? It's just nonsense.
Please follow the nurse's directions.
The police had all the evidence they needed.
This is more expensive than that.
They say that every year the number of tourists is greatest in October.
What would you like to eat today?
I promise I'll talk to him.
That factory makes toys.
I have to go the bathroom.
Sami wasn't sleeping.
His victory made him a hero.
Let's split.
I can't stand his arrogance.
Sami paid that 160 dollars.
I accept, but only under one condition.
I'm expecting your child.
I missed the last bus, and was obliged to walk home in the rain.
Sami gave Layla a hand with the job.
He became the company president when he was thirty.
All the phone calls that have been made came from the very same place.
She married a rich man.
This book is hard for me to read.
Layla was raised in a conservative community.
He always tells the truth.
Word spread of the attack.
What happened here?
Why is he here?
You don't have that, right?
I'll sue you.
Come on and tell me.
It is thirty meters in length.
When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
Thank you for your kindness.
How do you know that?
We require your help.
She prepared herself for the tennis match by practicing for hours every day.
Do you have anything to say?
Germany is a parliamentary republic.
Relevance is a key element in communication.
Children play with toys.
Get the fuck out of my life.
I know.
His leg was bitten by a crocodile.
Fadil took a public bus.
Sit down with me.
Sami spent Ramadan alone.
I want to know where she went.
Sami made a full recovery.
Can I borrow your scissors?
The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.
There's no job without benefit.
Environmentally damaging projects should be abandoned systematically.
I was named after my uncle.
It's just what we need.
You prefer living with books.
How many rooms are there in your house?
Sami sumbitted to that dangerous sexual game.
You broke the rules.
Sami went outside.
Sami suffered a huge depression.
We have the berber keyboard on our phones.
Fadil asked for the money back.
The war finally broke out.
He did not perish in vain.
Sami is tired of his life.
Sami removed his glasses.
It was my substitute teacher.
Andy must have practiced very hard.
There! She comes!
Can I go out to play?
No other dog is bigger than this.
Sami's house became haunted.
It may, indeed, be a mistake.
You seem an honest man.
Did you hear that sound?
You are free to go out.
They deserve it.
Are you through with the phone?
At first Mary had thought of renting out her house; but everyone advised her to sell it.
What are you laughing at?
We can't forget that.
Fadil lived in a housing development near Cairo.
This is my house.
I will gladly help you.
Why don't you want to tell us the truth?
They stood up for the rights of their nation.
He lied brazenly.
What is the most popular sport in America?
Please don't take my mind off the work.
Do you have any classes this afternoon?
Sami waved to Layla as she was driving away.
Everything was lost.
You look very tired.
I demolished the school.
The essence of liberty is mathematics.
Show me the pictures.
Sami was supporting a son in college.
Sami might have been poisoned.
I thought I did pretty well.
I will fly to Germany.
Layla knew Sami's voice.
She's my wife.
Tom is the only one who can do this.
I'm going to Mainz and then to Cologne next year.
Sami's birth resulted from an extramarital affair.
Fadil was bedridden.
Sami was my Arabic teacher.
Don't touch my camera.
I have little money.
Sami has officially gone missing on June 6th, 2006.
I want you to get out of town.
I know where Tom works.
An ant can lift more than 50 times its weight.
You must have seen him.
He hates me. And I hate him!
Sami had class on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Sami was in danger.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
He is preparing for the test.
Answer the telephone, will you?
She accused me of telling a lie.
Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it himself.
I've probably got an ulcer.
Stop!
This teacher terrorizes children.
Sami had to spend the night in the jungle.
I know him by his first name.
Sami was peeing.
I speak a little Slovenian.
Do you remember me?
History repeats itself.
He went over to the other side.
I'm your father.
She knows nothing about your family.
Sami baptised his children.
I don't have money.
Why are you being towed by a bus?
Maybe you should take a look at this again.
Who is that pretty girl?
Sami's girlfriend was cheating on him.
There were three men.
I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.
We don't know him.
Have you been shot?
Fadil wanted to control everybody.
Do you have a receipt?
Pull!
I didn't want to see Tom's face.
I am a student of this school.
Be silent, or speak something worth hearing.
Layla pled for Sami's help.
Make a good translation of the sentence that you are translating. Don't let translations into other languages influence you.
Sami likes hentai.
Where do you want me to sit?
I liked Tony.
Tom likes playing chess.
Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners of it.
I was very busy last week.
I'll attend.
Let's go see if Tom can help us.
I don't know where I should look.
We still have plenty of time.
May I ask where are you going?
That's the biggest strawberry I've ever seen.
The spy burned the papers.
We loved the substitute teacher.
She asked me how old I was.
Sami was riding the bus to work.
Don't forget our date tomorrow.
I've been at the station.
Tom is young and single.
The gang became Fadil's family.
It's the end of a world.
Tom asked Mary if she would help him.
Maybe she won't come.
That's not what I wanted to show you.
Tom works for an oil company.
You can both achieve your goals together.
Sami's birth resulted from an extramarital affair.
You should head west.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Tom and Mary were right.
OK, let's begin!
He's smart.
In France they say either " (téléphone) mobile" or "portable," but the latter is ambiguous, because you often cannot tell whether it refers to a telephone, a computer, or another portable device.
Do you love each other that much?
Thank you for your kind attention.
Much has been made of the fact that an African-American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique.
Snakes are -to a certain extent- deaf, but can still hear very low sounds and are very sensitive to smells.
They will get married next month.
I was afraid to lose you.
Sami asked the Lord to forgive him.
You ought to thank him.
I can carry those suitcases for you.
I played tennis all day.
No one could have predicted this.
You're still awake?
You must clean your room.
That is his car.
She's a student.
The teacher called my mom.
He is not in.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Sami picked Layla up at the airport.
Nobody answered the telephone.
It doesn't require you to be a polyglot.
Fadil was about seventeen years old at the time.
Tom pretended that he didn't see Mary.
I don't have any evidence.
Wait in the waiting room.
I told them to stay in their room.
Whose pen is this?
The population of this city is decreasing every year.
Layla made some terrible decisions in her life.
We are going downtown to eat pizza.
Tom doesn't like watching baseball.
Sami was never a Christian.
He doesn't run.
They have two daughters.
Fadil opened his own practice in Cairo.
She continued her talk.
There are many beautiful parks in London.
Don't worry about my dog.
What browser are you using?
I eat and drink.
Do you eat it in the classroom?
Layla locked her door.
The rumor isn't true.
I believe he is going to be rich one day.
She said that I should come home soon.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
We have no idea.
What do you think you're doing?
Sami opened the front door.
Layla threatens to scream at the top of her voice if you don't go see her.
I know those girls.
It's my job.
Sami fought hard for his life.
Keep learning and become a polyglot.
I could eat an elephant.
It cannot be completely cured.
I went to drink a beer with friends.
This news made Al-Sayib so furious that he once more spilled his Fanta.
Sami beat Layla to the extent she was hospitalized.
I added this website to my favorites.
I'll never let you do that again.
Fadil heard a thumping sound coming from the basement.
A boy like Tom doesn't deserve a girl like Mary.
I prefer biking.
There is a page missing.
Who broke the vase?
I bought some fresh eggs which had just come from the farm.
Arabic isn't hard.
Sami took me to a place and tried to rape me.
Do you have two computers?
I'm a doctor.
They all drank.
Let's discuss that problem later.
That wasn't my intention.
Fadil is over there.
Aart is a dangerous pedophile.
Tom will never do that.
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
How long have you been learning Arabic?
Nobody's indispensable.
Why weren't you here yesterday?
My brother is a teacher.
Will it rain tomorrow?
We should never forget it.
By the way, how many kids are going?
We're going to wait until Tom gets here.
Sami cares.
We were friends.
Now the ball is in your court!
Tom finished writing the report in less than three hours.
The little boy has lost the money given to him by his father.
Sami lived in a neighborhood where there was a lot of crime.
My teacher asked me out.
Tom is going to boarding school next year.
The tourist asked for lodging for the night.
Please fill out the attached application form.
I need a pencil.
Your house is very nice.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
Sami enjoyed living out a fantasy life.
They are controlling transmission.
Maybe some people just aren't meant to be together.
Sami hurt everyone.
You're either with me or against me.
You will see the difference.
I'm really tired.
This is a present for you.
Let's get ready to go.
Have a seat, please.
How's your brother?
You look like your father.
She became famous.
Tom is sitting at the table near the window.
The falling of the Berlin Wall was truly a momentous occasion.
This is a government project.
She talks a lot.
Gaza has passed the unlivability threshold.
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
What did you put into the boxes?
Helicopters are noisy.
Sami landed a residency at a Cairo hospital.
She came to Tokyo when she was 18.
Your room is cleaner than mine.
Mennad had an important appointment.
You can go to the station by bus.
Lack of sleep is bad for your health.
No one is going to shoot me.
Sami's crime stunned all the community.
I like playing baseball.
The teacher was about to finish the useless discussion when his face was hit by a blow from a pupil's fist.
You need to study more.
All members hope that Tatoeba will have a million sentences by the year's end.
Sami got very angry with the police.
"I wanna have a word with you." "Sure, what is it?"
Sami received life in prison.
We had an Egyptian teacher.
I don't like watching subtitled movies.
Sami searched for his children in Egypt but in vain.
Fadil wanted to start a new life.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
No one cares about that anymore.
Is your boyfriend here?
We went to the zoo.
It is a beautiful city.
Tourists should take care to respect local cultures when they are travelling.
Does he go to school by bus?
She has a soft and clear voice.
He wants vengeance.
You are to blame for the accident.
He was hit by a car and died right away.
Hi, Bill. How are you?
Sami worked occasionally as a handyman.
Maybe Tom saw something.
She did the job with ease.
They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with.
Sami drinks every day.
I'm here as a tourist.
I'll be back within an hour.
The salt, if you please.
In fact, he lied.
Shut all the doors and windows.
Sami noticed Layla.
Sami swallowed a bunch of pills.
Sami's life is wonderful.
I read at least one book every month.
We had a good time playing chess.
She is an atheist.
Sami started to cross over to a more dangerous style of life.
I don't have any evidence.
Sami wanted to read the letter.
Take your time
He wants you to stay here.
Still sleepy, right?
Sami had a dog.
Six times four is two dozen.
Tell me what happened.
I suffered through all sours but didn't find bitter than needing people.
Sami didn't know why.
Which one?
Please slow down when getting close to the intersection.
Sami needed help.
I've done business with Tom before.
You can always come here.
Sami was stunned.
English is difficult, isn't it?
Sami met a terrible end.
Can I help you?
Could you turn on your headlights?
Sami has taken his shahada.
She's married to Jamal.
My car is German.
I promise I will protect you.
You must help her.
The police are after me.
These clothes suit you fabulously.
Sami wanted to be friends with us.
Sami listened to the recording and heard a man's voice in the background.
It was another hollow promise.
I'm not going.
And if you see Tom, say hello to him for me.
There's something I forgot to say.
We've prepared well.
The doctor advised her to enter the hospital.
Sami was prepared.
My conscience is clear.
Sami was rolling in money.
You and I make a good team.
Sami offered police information.
I like your car.
Fadil decided he was going to be open about his conversion to Islam.
Jamal was fired from the construction site.
That church organization takes in refugees.
Sami was confused.
To the man who only has a hammer in the toolkit, every problem looks like a nail.
Why are you sleeping in a place like this?
The new plan has been very successful.
Why are you showing me this picture?
Fadil was well respected in the community.
She doesn't close the door.
My life was in danger.
Sami watched every video on Layla's YouTube channel.
Run!
Aaah!! My computer is broken!
Tom always has a smile on his face.
We have a cat. We are all fond of it.
Sami wasn't a confrontational person.
Don't disappoint me.
Tom doesn't have many books.
You can't bring your cat to school.
Every man has a right to his own property.
Emily ate an apple.
You must quit smoking cigarettes.
Sami didn't want to have a face-to-face confrontation with Farid.
Sami started attending a halaqa at high school.
Why did you leave your job?
She went out for a walk.
Hello again.
Could you lower the volume of the television?
This is my computer.
Sami praised Layla as being the love of his life.
Tom drove the car.
Nobody cares about that.
Please drive carefully.
Mind your own business!
Layla settled in Cairo, Egypt.
Try some.
How should I know?
It's very hot here.
I want you to find her.
I'm not stupid, am I?
Then just forget her. Leave her in peace.
Sami hasn't been hearing from Layla for six days.
Sami started embezzling money.
It tastes really good.
Sami was just watching.
We went to the same church.
She is unconscious.
Tom was the only one in the house.
You are not allowed to violate the rules.
Why are you doing this?
Everyone was happy.
Aart made a racist statement in front of me.
Sami stayed out of trouble.
That car is very new.
He wept over his misfortunes.
See you tomorrow at the library.
Not every day is Sunday.
Are you a smoker?
Legend has it that this house is haunted.
May I ask a couple of questions?
I'm from America.
Sami hates that teacher.
I met him while going back home.
Sami was stalking the beach, looking for a victim.
Have a blessed Isra and Mi'raj.
Sami waited six more months.
Sami didn't know about Layla's relationship with Farid.
Just say that I can't see him.
The ship will set sail for Hong Kong tomorrow at 3 p.m.
I think that's what happened.
Bring him to me.
It's a magic number.
Do you know what time it is?
Carlos climbed the mountain.
How do you know that belongs to Tom?
It would seem that the weather is improving.
I want to go with you.
That hotel was very near the lake.
A collection of her verses has just been published.
Impossible.
Mr. Sato asked me many questions about the election.
Layla admitted she argued with her husband Sami the day he disappeared.
Everybody laughed.
Sami went to meet Layla.
My father is going to China.
Layla started dating Sami.
I'm in love with you and I want to marry you.
Sami is attending a wedding.
Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.
I owe my success to their help.
When a child, I used to go fishing with him.
The weather has been good until today.
Sami led Layla to the garage where Farid attacked her.
She will always be with you.
He accomplished the work as planned.
My wife and Mary were in the rear of the aircraft.
I am greatly indebted to you for all you have done for me.
It was cold here through March.
I exercise because I want to stay healthy.
My orders are absolute.
She has blue eyes.
Aren't you Tom's mother?
He gave her a piece of advice.
"Could it be...?" Dima wondered. "Did I finally get the right Al-Sayib?"
Incredibly, Sami clung to life.
Give me back my husband!
Your hair's beautiful.
After Jim converted to Islam, he took a Muslim name.
I like French.
I never looked for you.
I don't know how to drive a car.
Jump as high as you can.
I've made my decision.
Sami and Layla were a picture perfect family in a picture perfect American town.
"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked.
I am sorry.
That boy's hair is black.
Sami was from a practising Muslim family.
Sami told his dad.
Sami made it to Cairo.
I'd like to travel around the world.
They were excited to meet Jamal.
He has a large family to support.
I must request you to obey my orders.
Does Nancy want to have a dog?
What's this strange music?
You disappointed me.
It wasn't the first time they had done it.
Do not laugh at the weak-minded and the disabled.
How beautiful Algeria's flag is!
I know only this.
I like canned fruits.
We call him Mike.
That's extraordinary.
Layla had a son.
Sami makes good money.
Tom never lied.
Sami was on medication.
Sami tells me everything.
Emily can swim.
Layla kept driving.
Layla wanted to attract attention.
Do you know the boy in the picture?
It is impossible to finish the report in a week.
Sami heard a shot.
Sami was trained into obedience.
To make matters worse, her husband died.
The solar altitude is 20 degrees.
Sami was Layla's life.
So all you need is good cheese and a jar of black cherry jam.
Sami speaks his mind.
Sami had a few classes with Layla.
How often do you forget to do your homework?
I'm really not hungry.
Sami crawled into the window.
I don't want to look silly.
Sami loved being a Muslim.
Layla taught Sunday school.
How do you know this?
This was a murder for money.
I don't want Sami here.
He is busy doing something.
I work for an oil company.
Don't try to trick us.
Yitzhak, just as Sami, believes that it is possible for Jews and Arabs to live in a single democratic state where there are no racist policies to discriminate against anyone because of their race or religion.
Collective punishment is very common in the West Bank and it is permanent in the Gaza Strip.
Sami has already subscribed to Layla's YouTube channel.
I don't have an excuse.
They checked how pure the water was.
There's no love without jealousy.
Layla was losing blood fast.
I know him.
I shook hands with the former student.
Sami knew Layla was not in danger.
Whose son are you?
That student is very active.
From which Surah is this Ayah from?
Sami knew who attacked him.
The people of Gaza are living under a crippling blockade.
I think you'd better take a rest; you look ill.
Sami gave Layla some change for the bus.
A pelican can fit a lot of fish in its beak.
When did you get back from your trip?
I have to study Japanese.
Is that a yes or no?
It didn't really happen the way Tom said it did.
Sami used three different textbooks to learn Arabic.
How do you know Tom and Mary aren't lying?
He died fighting in the Vietnam War.
You're either with us or against us.
I'll take you back home to change your clothes.
They were getting married.
Sami sat in the mosque and read a few chapters of the Quran.
She is in the bathroom.
Stop the car.
Tom could've said something.
I have a TV in my bedroom.
Here's the bus.
Sami ran into a tree because he couldn't see a thing.
I don't know what will pass.
We are going to a dance tomorrow.
What turned her against you?
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Another lot of tourists arrived.
I spent all afternoon in the library.
That was hard to believe.
For our friendship!
Fadil fell for an Egyptian woman.
He solved the problem with ease.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
Sami lived in this neighborhood.
Not here!
She is not in the least worried about her test scores.
Layla was airlifted to a local hospital.
You're giving a speech tomorrow aren't you?
That's what I loved about Tom.
Everything is theoretically impossible until it's done.
Sami treats Layla the way she deserves to be treated.
We'll kill you.
Sami is awake.
I accompanied him on the trip.
Layla was dying.
They called off their visit to London.
I want to read that book.
Is there someone here who speaks English?
Can we forget about that?
It's fun to play, too.
But why?
Sami was a child in danger.
Maybe you know where my books are?
We don't know the lyrics.
May I use the toilet?
I'll miss all of you.
That's what people say.
Let's just pretend like we don't know each other.
I'm sure Tom is planning to do that.
In everyday life no one speaks in verse.
Sami eats there.
Sami told Layla to wait.
"Yes, that's me," said Al-Sayib. "But there's at least one of us in every country. And we all like Fanta, as well as putting noobs in their place."
I didn't have a choice.
Do you travel a lot?
Sami was developing an even more dangerous habit.
We wouldn't go if it rained.
Somebody is eating.
Are you sure?
He's a biologist.
Sami lived a charmed life.
I know Tom loves Mary.
Layla was pregnant with Sami's baby.
Whose image is on this stamp?
If they close down this clinic, we will all lose our jobs.
We found the front door locked.
Sami wanted to make Layla love him.
I'm paid by the day.
He concentrated on his studies.
He called me Ichiro.
How long will the storm last?
You might want to talk to Tom.
I'd like to mail this package to Canada.
We must all take care to preserve our national heritage.
Why are you so selfish?
Excuse me.
Sami was spending more and more time with Layla.
Sami did what Layla asked him to do.
Muslims believe that Jesus was one of God's messengers.
Most of the people I chat with on Facebook are students.
I need the keys.
I'm going to be in the bathroom.
I will go to school.
Bilal is taller than Karam.
This letter is addressed to you.
Sami created a phony e-mail address.
Tatoeba: Sentences, sentences, and more sentences.
We're students.
"Hold on," Dima said, taking out his phone. "I know someone who could lend me some money."
This noise is deafening.
I knew it was you.
Sami never talked to the doctor about that.
I don't know if we needed that.
Sami was peeking through this hole.
After that, what happened?
Which university are you studying at?
Why didn't you come for dinner?
The door is closed.
Is this your son, Betty?
It will aggravate the wound.
The teacher was so nice.
Don't judge others based on the color of their skin.
I feel hungry.
I missed my stop.
He is a very smart boy.
I paid him five dollars.
Some people read the newspaper and watch TV at the same time.
I've decided to tell the truth.
Sami didn't feel Christian.
She came to Japan as a child.
Fadil wanted to spend more time with Layla.
Music is an international language.
The houses and cars looked tiny from the sky.
Why is it that you're always late?
I'm the director of this clinic.

Why are those people climbing up on the roof?

Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Do you remember Mr Saito?
Ken goes swimming day after day.
