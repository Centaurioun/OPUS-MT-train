I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting it.
My sister is shorter than you.
I love you.
Marika is Finnish but she speaks German just like the Germans.
How do you spell "pretty"?
My sister always keeps her room clean.
Have you seen her?

I hate those spiders. They're always there to freak me out when I'm cleaning.
He is older than Jane by two years.
Is there somewhere that we can talk privately about this?
It's great to win.
She was kind to me.
Excuse me; allow me to point out three errors in the above article.
I'm not sure that that's how it happened.
Whose is this?
Jim accompanied her on the piano.
Nobody understands me.
Don't you even think of eating my chocolate!
It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
Thanks, that's all.
Don't expect others to think for you!
"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
Your behavior brought disgrace on our family.
What did you answer?
When did Tom try doing that?
I love Algerian food.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
Why don't we go home?
Get the fuck out!
He stole my watch.
Who did you vote for?
His arrival was greeted with cheers.
It's a pity when somebody dies.
I wait here until she comes.
He crushed the sheet of paper up into a ball.
Did you have fun?
May I use your pencil?
Not wanting is the same as having.
How long does it take to get to the station?
You look stupid.
We are men.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't underestimate my power.
How many friends do you have on Facebook?
Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
It's lonely in the saddle since the horse died.
I should have agreed to help Tom with that.
I'm still waiting to see Tom.
Tom's hair is really short.
My cat barks.
Tom found Mary hiding in the closet.
Don't ask them where they are going.
I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
What?
I'm pretty sure that's how it happened.
I want Tom to sing with me.
I did that one time.
I would never have guessed that.
The apple has begun to decay.
Tom's house was built in 2013.
"Where's Laurie?" "She's in the kitchen."
You're just running away from life's problems.
Tom wasn't allowed to visit his father in prison.
Jugurtha was a king of Numidia.
Tom is drinking some coffee.
She lies to you all the time.
The world is a den of crazies.
I know what Tom wants to buy.
There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
I think it is best not to be impolite.
I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
Come on, play with me, I'm so bored!
Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
There are almost no books.
It's too late to do anything about that now.
Then there is a problem...
The party that we've been invited to is tomorrow, not today.
I remember no such thing.
We must move quickly.
Life without love is just totally pointless.
If we should miss the train, we'll go by bus.
Do you like mussels?
Tom gave me a pen.
It's hot out here.
Guess what!
It would be something I'd have to program.
This is fucking awesome.
It's not something anyone can do.
Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
I just won a lot of money.
You're lucky because he didn't bite you.
"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
What're we waiting for?
Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
I have a bone to pick with you.
It is not rare at all to live over ninety years.
Wash your hands.
That's my cat.
I'm learning Turkmen.
I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
Does he have rice?
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
Tom's friends are helping him.
Stop blaming yourselves.
You had better go.
Seeing that you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
Tom was so angry.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom and his friends are playing poker.
Where are you going to go?
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
"Who is it?" "It's your mother."
I have a dream.
We walked a lot.
I like candlelight.
Fill it up, please.
This carpet is very long.
It only shows you're not a robot.
Excuse me, but can you help me?
The road is frozen! Don't let him drive!
I hate it when there are a lot of people.
I always go to school on foot.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
What gives?
What do you think of this red hat?
I watched TV after I washed the dishes.
Tom's dead.
I'm going to go to the doctor this afternoon.
You aren't allowed in this room.
It is unfortunately true.
Your coat is very beautiful.
Why not both?
Who the fuck cares?
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
Now I live with my uncle.
Mom, I'm home.
I don't intend to do that.
Are you going to go?
I didn't like it.
I need a knife.
May I have a sip of your wine?
We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools.
Where are you going to go?
My father converted a garage into a study.
"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
I am Palestinian.
This hat is too tight for me.
You aren't allowed in here.
They're strong.
"Trust me," he said.
Thanks for your explanation.
I wasn't allowed to leave.
I want you to read this book.
You'll forget about me someday.
I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
Guess what!
Do you have enough information to go on?
What other options do I have?
Sumatra is an island.
I'm making tea.
Are you sure that Tom wasn't the one who did that?
I wish I could go to Japan.
The Berber language has an academy in Algeria now.
I didn't know what Tom knew.
"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
The old man is blind in one eye.
How long did you stay?
They say love is blind.
It tastes very good, doesn't it?
I knew who Tom had talked to.
I just wanted to check my email.
Did you see it?
Open at page nine.
Can it be phrased in another way?
This sign says "do not feed the animals."
What do you think I've been doing?
It seems interesting to me.
There was hardly anyone in the room.
You're not fast enough.
It's a surprise.
The devil is in the details.
You aren't allowed in this room.
I think exams are ruining education.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
His clothes always smell bad.
May I ask a question?
Thank you.
That's because you're a girl.
If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
Don't run, walk slowly.
That is intriguing.
She is able to speak ten languages.
I told him to stop.
Why don't you come visit us?
Somebody came into our house and stole some stuff while we were asleep.
Well, what?
Do you speak Filipino?
Tom is womanizer.
I teach.
Sorry I startled you!
It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.
Stop it! You're making her feel uncomfortable!
Tom and Mary are playing poker.
She's asking how that's possible.
I don't intend to do what Tom told me to do.
I have won.
How do you find food in outer space?
Did you see it?
The ghost story was terrifying.
Ken calls me every day.
The failure in business left me penniless.
"Yes, orange juice please," says Mike.
I think I know what Tom is doing here.
I can't explain it either.
It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
How much do you want be paid?
OK, this is what we are going to do.
Fuck.
I've always wanted a daughter.
We don't know our neighbors.
This is a horse.
I have been obsessed with French recently.
After lunch we have two more classes.
I think you'd better leave.
One can always find time.
I don't like you anymore.
If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
Round trip? Only one-way.
He crossed the street.
If it were not for water, no living things could live.
When he said "water," she gave him water.
She brushes the horse.
If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
Thank you!
It doesn't surprise me.
You look stunning!
I mistook him for his brother.
Come on, Jiro.
Communism will never be reached in my lifetime.
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
Why are you so mad at Tom?
What's up?
You must not despise someone because they are poor.
The school is closed because of the snow.
She left school two years ago.
You really don't have the right priorities!
We have no school tomorrow.
Boston is not at all like Chicago.
You aren't allowed in here.
I don't speak Japanese.
Lovely sunset, isn't it?
Someday I'll run like the wind.
We need a car.
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
Tom's hair is really short.
We need a car.
But do you like it?
"How do you feel?" he inquired.
She forgave him.
Are you teaching Spanish?
Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna shoot him.
He is no good as a doctor.
Uh... How's that working?
A Japanese would never do such a thing.
In the 1950's, the Finns were cited as having one of the least healthy diets in the world.
It's hot out here.
I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.
For some reason I feel more alive at night.
I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.
Fuck it.
Don't open before the train stops.
Tom was a bit shy.
It's not much of a surprise, is it?
When did Tom buy that shirt?
Muiriel is 20 now.
They always complain.
How do you know that Tom has never been to Boston?
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
You never have class or what?!
"That's very nice of you," Willie answered.
You are free to go home.
They are making a salad.
Who doesn't know this problem?!
Do you need me to give you some money?
Are you fucking stupid?
The man was eating bread.
Why are you so mad at Tom?
Eat whenever you like.
He didn't just eat 1 pear, but 3.
It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
"Haven't we met somewhere before?" asked the student.
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
He cared for his mother after his father died.
I'll take him.
Most people think I'm crazy.
You never have time for important things!
I need to apologize to Tom.
A rat ran across the road.
Tom wanted to know the truth.
Is there a youth hostel near here?
"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
No one will know.
You're in better shape than I am.
I go shopping every morning.
Can you wait a bit?
I pretended to be happy.
Apart from sports, I like listening to jazz music.
I ran home.
People from Madrid are weird.
You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
I pretended to work.
Tom is only a little older than Mary.
His arrival was greeted with cheers.
Open the doors.
Tom is the one who told me when the meeting would be.
They did not abide by the school regulations.
Please don't cry.
I can only wait.
I think Tom was born in Boston.
I'm 25 years old.
This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
Did you win the race?
Is it bad?
I didn't want this to happen.
Would you like something to drink?
With whom are you talking?
I don't know what to do anymore.
I smell blood.
Tom made these for you.
Tom was scared to death.
Tom is very slim.
He wasn't ready for it.
I need to ask you a silly question.
He left the room as soon as I entered it.
There is a small garden in front of my house.
Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
All you can do is trust one another.
That's my cat.
It's because you don't want to be alone.
Tom was a bit shy.
Do you know how to drive a car?
My daughter likes summer fruits, such as cherries, watermelons and peaches.
The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
Don't call Tom anymore.
The poor little girl did nothing but weep.
I suppose that behind each thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
Love is never wasted.
Open the doors.
With so many people around he naturally became a bit nervous.
Good job!
We weren't allowed to go into that cave.
It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
Keep an eye on the naughty kid.
Is it far from here?
I have bad news for you.
I just won a lot of money.
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
Fuck you!
How old are you?
What, again?
Can I use your pen?
The Germans are very crafty.
I think so, too.
I have lost my wallet.
They are big.
He eats nothing more than fruit.
I don't intend to do that.
Jugurtha was born in Cirta.
"She likes music." "So do I."
I count on Tom.
When I woke up, I was sad.
Tom is the one who showed me how to do it.
He was sitting beside his brother.
I'd like to help you.
Tom told you, didn't he?
Humans were never meant to live forever.
Eat whatever you want to.
Larbi Ben M'hidi is Algerian.
But the universe is infinite.
Why do you work here?
You aren't allowed in there.
I don't intend to be selfish.
Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
Are you sure?
Please help me.
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
Guess what!
The mandatory character of schooling is rarely analyzed in the multitude of works dedicated to the study of the various ways to develop within children the desire to learn.
I wonder how long it's going to take.
And yet, the contrary is always true as well.
It's too bad that I don't need to lose weight.
Take your hands off me!
I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
It has been so long since I last went to Disneyland with my family.
Tom wanted to be a scientist.
I'd like to help you.
In other words, he is lazy.
Ten years is a long time to wait.
She used to go mountain climbing with him.
I think I have a theory about that.
What's her name?
What keeps you up so late?
He was good and drunk.
I'm calling because my credit card has been stolen.
There she comes.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
Stop asking me for a drink! Go get it yourself.
Bearing can be unbearable.
The more you eat Kuqa's apricots, the more of them you'll want to eat.
When did Tom learn to dance?
I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
There are too many things to do!
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
Have you bought a watermelon?
I can't understand her way of thinking at all.
So what?
Have you seen it?
Uh, now it's really weird...
The octopus is in the sea.
Hurry up.
Oh, there's a butterfly!
Steve, I heard you were the baby of the family.
You aren't allowed in there.
So annoying... Now I get a headache whenever I use the computer!
Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
I'm at a loss for words.
You are free to go home.
Do you have enough information to go on?
Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
It's difficult for me to solve this problem.
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
I wonder why we play tennis in miniskirts.
What could it be?
That won't happen.
I need to feed the dog.
I don't speak Hebrew.
Fuck off!
When I left the train station, I saw a man.
Anybody who wants to come is invited.
I can survive alone.
I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.
My parents keep arguing about stupid things. It's so annoying!
My parents are going to kill me!
How are you?
Don't be overconfident.
I don't like it when mathematicians who know much more than I do can't express themselves explicitly.
I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
It was found at the bottom of the river.
Don't be so stupid.
Are they all the same?
I think we're going to be late.
Can I use your pencil?
Would you like to dance with me?
It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
When did you go?
Come and write your name.
I count on Tom.
They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.
I'm just saying!
Don't be so stupid.
Can you rub my back?
We didn't do a thing.
Do you miss Tom?
We eat to live, not live to eat.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
She was kind to me.
That's MY line!
There's a problem there that you don't see.
We can't sleep because of the noise.
Tom looks strong.
I am not much of a traveller.
He's swimming.
Palestine is called "Filastin" in Arabic.
Jim has not yet returned home.
Gas prices are up.
Could you dial for me? The telephone is too high.
I just don't know what to say.
I have nothing better to do.
I'm not afraid of spiders.
It is already eleven.
What time did Tom get here?
I will tell him about it when he comes next time.
I'm happy with my life.
I'm about to lose my mind.
You aren't allowed in there.
I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
Liar!
That's my cat.
Tom is the one who gave me this bicycle.
They advised us to stay put for the time being.
She is strong.
This is a house to let, not to be sold.
Boston is not at all like Chicago.
Larbi Ben M'hidi is Algerian.
This is what I would have said.
After that, I left, but then I realized that I forgot my backpack at their house.
This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
I am buying a new umbrella.
If we should miss the train, we'll go by bus.
I can't imagine my life without you.
I'll speak with the teacher.
I'm so fat.
Mary is alone in the forest.
I just gave it to Tom.
You mustn't answer your mother back when she scolds you.
Do whatever he tells you.
I'm going to go.
We're old friends.
Don't treat me like a child.
You aren't allowed in here.
Have you fed the dog yet?
Poor is not the one who has too little, but the one who wants too much.
Could I use your pencil?
Do you know how to use a dictionary?
Above and beyond this, he can read Hebrew.
Thank you very much!
We're old friends.
Foreign people intrigue me.
Thank you!
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
John isn't here.
Do you know what time the shop is closed?
I need to apologize to Tom.
Oh, my white pants! And they were new.
Tom had forgotten his umbrella so I lent him one of mine.
Tom never forgets to say thank you.
I pretended not to understand what he was saying.
He seems to be aware of my feelings.
I thought you liked to learn new things.
Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
Are you going to sleep?
This is never going to end.
You wanted to tell me about freedom?
I don't speak French.
I shouldn't have logged off.
Tom is very slim.
I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
Tom bought each of his children a yellow umbrella.
I'm Tom's doctor.
I have not heard from her for a month.
This castle overlooks the city.
They wanted a wedding picture in front of the Eiffel Tower.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
We're out of sugar.
I am tired of my work.
Tom was so angry.
Where are you going to go?
What do you mean you don't know?!
It's not their fault.
I think so, too.
When did you go?
Better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you're not.
Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
But the possibility seems unlikely.
The cost of life increased drastically.
What's your occupation?
With whom are you talking?
Do you miss Tom?
I can't live without a TV.
I pretended to work.
Children like fruit juice.
Hebrew is a difficult language.

Close the fucking door!
Can I turn off the TV?
The ghost story was terrifying.
Yumi is happy, isn't she?
I'm happy that you did that for me.
Give me my pen back.
Don't wake up the sleeping child.
I'll peel an orange for you.
It can't be!
All that which is invented, is true.
You are free to go home.
When did Tom buy these eggs?
I don't intend to do what Tom asked me to do.
This is a pun.
You've lied to me before. Why should I trust you now?
The sea is green.
Do you have a condom?
The house is cold.
Eat a lot!
I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.
The prisoner is being quiet in the cell today.
I don't intend to do what Tom asked me to do.
To be perfect she lacked just one defect.
What's his name?
Rye was called the grain of poverty.
She was ready to help him with cleaning the house.
It seems like you know everything already.
His story is true.
In order to do that, you have to take risks.
If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
I may give up soon and just nap instead.

That was probably what influenced their decision.
It is said that "Hamlet" is the most interesting play ever written.
You mustn't forget to come and see me tomorrow morning.
You can probably guess what happens though.
Pull into shape after washing.
It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.
This is always the way it has been.
Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
Great people are not always wise.
Fuck!
Damn! It's not bad!
I'm more afraid of them than I am of you.
When's the wedding?
Don't treat me like a child.
Tom was at Mary's house.
If you don't eat, you die.
I was in the mountains.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
Pretend you didn't see me.
Mary is cute, but I don't think she's very smart.
You should sleep.

I make €100 a day.
