Tom finished his coffee and left for work.
I came to Boston last month.
Shit stinks.
Would you like something to drink?
Do write to me soon!
Tom is a gentleman.
Muiriel is 20 now.
They came together.
I never should've brought you here.
As a result of the collision, one of the passengers was thrown out.
We didn't talk yesterday.
Not until late at night did he come home.
A new idea came to me.
Don't let him keep this picture.
You can't possibly win.
Thanks for doing that for us.
The driver was so fortunate as to escape death.
You must be so proud of him.
Where do you think all the money goes?
Oh, I do wish I could go to France.
The book is on the table.
I didn't know Tom lived in Boston.
I just want to hug you.
Tom turned off the music.
Which would you prefer, coffee or tea?
Is my explanation clear?
Sue and John decided to get married.
He laid his bag on the table.
Tom is down.
She bought some meat and eggs so that she might make omelets.
You are very brave.
We'll be waiting.
This is the word which I would like to replace.
They appear dead.
I really like him, but not his circle of friends.
This is a lesson for me.
You will pay for it.
I know it's important work.
Do you like to travel?
There's something you should see.
We can solve this.
Which group is your friend in?
Leave me alone!
A mother is responsible for the conduct of her children.
He does nothing but watch TV all day long.
Both of my kids have already graduated from high school.
Somebody is eating.
Have you ever seen one of these before?
She could feel her knees shaking.
Green leaves are coming out little by little.
Do you have any problems with that?
They are more active at night.
An old woman limped along the street.
I'll give it to you.
The shop carried leather goods.
I wanted to see them.
It is very important to keep your word.
Is it yours?
What should you do if you are bitten by a cobra?
I have been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
Do you want to do this or not?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Goodnight!
We always play tennis on Saturday morning.
Where did I put it?
During the battle, it was as if time had stopped.
Can you stay long?
I do not know.
Tom is selling his sheep.
They fixed it.
We had Tom paint the wall.
Take it off.
We can't pretend it never happened.
Tom jumped out of the helicopter.
They all talked.
They finally left.
They drank coffee.
They're talking to her.
I need to have a haircut.
I'm not sure if Tom saw it.
They already left.
I drink alcohol.
We're concerned about Tom's future.
We reported his disappearance.
John is a veterinarian.
I want you to get started right away.
She's mine.
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox?
Is that all you're going to tell me?
All the soldiers were gallant.
I've been wrong.
It wasn't you, was it?
Each room is equipped with large desks.
There's something true in what he says.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
They found this.
This truck is in need of repair.
I lived in Boston for about three years.
Can you talk to him?
My car ran out of gas.
He went out of the room without being noticed by anyone.
What is it?
Tom and I had an agreement.
Just get back.
Tom drove along a desert road.
Does anybody know him?
I'll be waiting.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
You will be ignored.
They all knew.
Like father, like son.
All the passengers were killed in the airplane crash.
I'll be watching you.
She closes the door.
Here's one I forgot.
Tom didn't show up for dinner.
We reported his disappearance.
More than half of the residents are opposed to the plan.
I gave him back his ring.
She is cold to me.
Tom wanted to save the world.
Our captain got sick, so I attended the meeting in his place.
The earth is a ball.
Are you free tomorrow?
Thanks for the advice, Tom.
We don't know just yet.
She is a famous singer.
Do you like tea?
Rats don't have nephews.
She has psychic abilities.
Is your watch correct?
Do you think I'm crazy?
Tom accepted Mary's offer.
Don't forget about us!
Oh, don't be like that.
They caught me.
Do you drink coffee?
They usually sleep in this room.
I'd like to ask you about Tom.
In a store if you break something you must pay for it.
I want that cat.
Armenia is a mountainous country.
Who's free?
Don't give up your day job.
He was asking about your health.
What's in these boxes?
I could scarcely believe it.
Tom is talking with someone right now. Can you wait?
Make sure you tell him that.
The English entered into the tea trade at that time.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Tom wept.
Tom wanted to save the world.
The public is requested not to litter in these woods.
Tom certainly was polite.
The bottle is full.
I have a brand new pair of socks.
Tom may be hurt.
I'll tell them you called.
Tom got a bargain price.
I thought you had taken everything out of the office.
Tom won that contest.
He came over and cooked dinner for me.
What's your last name?
I'm sick.
Tom got some money from his father.
I'll write to Tom.
He fell victim to his own ambition.
We can't see it.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
She woke up naked on the floor.
I am thankful for my children.
They'll find Tom.
Tom will never do that.
She got him to eat his vegetables.
Tom didn't look like a doctor.
Tom knows what this means.
I am sewing my shirt.
I neither drink nor smoke.
I don't know if I have the time.
He is thought to be difficult to deal with.
The bird is in the sky.
Everybody got scared.
We'll have a French test on Monday.
I would like to buy some aspirin.
I am thankful for my children.
The city was destroyed by fire.
He failed the entrance exam.
Don't cut your hair!
Can you think of anyone more suitable?
I'm at home.
They work at night.
Tom used to go fishing with his father.
It is too risky.
I told Tom everything I could think of.
Let's go!
My room has two windows.
What's in these boxes?
What happened in Vietnam was like a bad dream.
You have thirty minutes left.
Burn not your house to fright the mouse away.
What is your last name?
I think I've found a meteorite.
Rambo doesn't exist.
Excuse me.
I'm at home.
Happy birthday, Muiriel!
The government was earning more money than it needed.
Don't forget the ticket.
They need to talk.
Tom visited Boston last year.
I love a woman.
Do you eat meat?
We lost it.
I traveled to Italy last summer.
I've got to do this now.
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
They aren't dead.
What do you think I was doing?
It is still light outside.
Where is your father?
We have to help her.
Do you speak Japanese?
They all sat.
Why do you allow Mary to do this to you?
I just want you to know that Tom is safe.
Just imagine: he is a doctor, and yet he is a smoker.
My parents were proud of me.
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
They drove home.
Tom wanted to stick around for a few more days.
Let me walk you to your car.
I thought Tom was supposed to be in Boston. What's he doing here?
I didn't like it.
Some of them are too much to bear.
Do you think I'd look good with a mustache?
Stand up!
Did anybody follow you?
Who's in command?
I've found something amazing!
Tom wished he was with Mary.
We have pictures.
I'll tell you everything.
I made that for you.
It's a waste of time and money.
I can't do this anymore.
Should that happen, what will you do?
Tom is watching TV now.
I won't do it again.
Some kinds of food make us thirsty.
Do you think Tom knows?
They burned themselves.
He is a man of profound knowledge.
My prayers were answered.
They didn't run.
What kind of mushrooms are they?
What would you like to eat?
I'll certainly talk to Tom.
They looked down on him.
Of course!
Would it be possible to replace a man's tooth with one from an animal?
I said leave Tom alone.
Who turned off the light?
Do you think it's safe to do that?
They can't escape.
I have plans with Tom tonight.
They all watched.
He was blind from birth.
Tom took everything to his office.
They can help.
Let me explain.
They buried it.
Tom doesn't even know my name.
It was a lie.
Tom is busy.
I have to go to sleep.
Let's go meet them.
It's too expensive.
I eat using a utensil.
They all died.
May I have your email, please?
I won't let anything bad happen.
Do I have to do it now?
Didn't you know that she passed away about two years ago?
I am very tired.
The city was destroyed by fire.
They stopped talking.
Today is Independence Day.
I pointed this out to her.
I will have him call you the moment he gets back.
It only happened once.
We shall do this free of charge.
How did Tom manage that?
Are you going to do that again?
This is Mary's dog.
They both coughed.
You must be so proud of her.
Tom went back to his seat.
That was the scary part.
They stayed one more day together.
They're here to protect him.
The worst is still to come.
Tom didn't buy me what I needed.
Tom is out of the office.
Tom might not make it in time.
Who are you talking about?
Tom didn't even text Mary to tell her he'd be late.
Those are the children you gave the book to.
I spent all day yesterday with him.
The city wants to extend the road.
Broccoli is one of the best vegetables for you.
Did you hear about Tom and Mary?
Everyone likes him.
It looked funny.
There are four seasons in a year - spring, summer, fall, and winter.
I like candy, too.
You are ill.
Thanks for the advice, Tom.
Tom had never seen Mary so happy.
You wouldn't lie.
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission.
Tom is busy.
What became of her?
Muiriel is 20 now.
Are you tired?
I want to drink it.
I don't know what I know.
Could we meet again?
I'll make you happy.
We have a lot to celebrate.
I'm taking notes.
Tom made three changes.
Tom should be home by 2:30.
It doesn't surprise me.
What do you want?
Tom is getting ready to go to work.
She has quite a lot of clothes.
My foot fell asleep.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
I hope it'll be quiet.
This dog is mine.
He's three years older than I am.
Now we don't know what to do.
So far he has admitted nothing.
Tom almost never asks about that.
The young girl is singing.
We didn't talk yesterday.
They all walked.
I'll be with you in ten minutes.
I've never had a beer in the middle of the day before.
What do you want me to do?
Doctors did everything they could to cure him.
My parents still haven't met my girlfriend.
Please excuse my being late.
It was her fault.
I don't want to go to school.
I've never drank milk with tea.
I exercise because I want to stay healthy.
Show her what you're capable of.
Make sure you tell her that.
Do you love me?
That he would be able to do.
We're studying now.
I had never been there before.
I study Korean.
We are keeping a big dog.
I've missed something.
The entire nation was glad at the news.
Where are you from?
He doesn't listen to his teachers.
He was arrested because he stole the money.
We have plans.
They don't understand.
Tom didn't get what he wanted.
I think it's possible that he may come.
I'm ready for a vacation.
He is good at handball.
They found Tom.
She decided to be a doctor.
Are you ready to go?
They believe you.
I want you to turn off the radio.
She is younger than me.
I've had enough.
Nobody called you.
Are you looking for somebody?
For whom will you vote for president?
It is said that nobody has solved the problem yet.
I'm thirsty.
She was scared to cross the road.
Do you drink?
Tom moved the flower pot to the left and the secret door slid open.
He named his son James.
It's no longer that way.
I'm at home.
When do you usually eat lunch?
Where can we meet you?
I know Tom isn't guilty.
I remember it all.
I have no time.
Why isn't Tom doing something?
Watch them closely.
Should I tell Tom you're unavailable?
Where are you going?
May I borrow your dictionary?
How many hotels do you think there are in Boston?
Is this your bicycle?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
They aren't there.
We have made friends with Tom.
You are always complaining.
This car runs on alcohol.
This is what's going to happen.
Maybe they'll come for you.
We have been in Paris.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
You're too big.
I think Tom did this.
Tom doesn't know what that is.
Where is your school?
This discovery will be recorded in history.
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
This is what's going to happen.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He asked me where to go.
They followed Tom.
I forgot to shutter the windows before the storm hit.
There's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.
I bought this book in Boston last month.
It's raining.
This house has a solid foundation.
Tom certainly is knowledgeable.
Tom and I are both nervous.
The concert will take place next Sunday.
How many close friends do you have?
Tom and I'll both be there.
We've been married more than thirty years.
Horses are animals.
This is an easy mistake to make.
She is a well-known singer.
Lisa speaks not only English but also French.
Do I have to pay you?
Who's free?
I want a knife with which to cut the rope.
I have two cats.
It looks like Tom isn't interested in that.
Tom is married to a foreigner.
Congratulations!
What got into you?
That's my dog.
You never said anything.
John is a veterinarian.
They have a kid.
Few people seem to have read the book.
How do you translate "Pfirsichbaeumchen" into Berber?
Everybody got scared.
You are my friend.
You're paying.
Tom has something he wants to say.
Tom translated the contract into French.
Her purse is the same color as her shoes.
We can solve this.
What is your last name?
They all stopped.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
He caught the cord.
What's your last name?
Your watch seems to be very valuable.
I don't know.
He put some coins in the box.
It's Tom's decision.
I'm not chicken.
She quickly went up the stairs.
I'm not talking about that.
I think you should help her.
What kind of man was he?
They followed you.
He plays the piano very well.
We heard them.
Nobody seems to be in charge.
A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert.
Do your best and don't worry.
I don't have any cash on me.
Where are you?
They found nothing.
Tom did an incredible job.
Tom drank milk.
I need a cup of hot coffee.
The train was almost empty.
Come in, it's open.
Maybe I could go with you.
You're stronger today.
Thank you for your opinion.
I see you reading.
She was like a second mother to me.
Don't expose it to the rain.
How are you?
What is your name?
I wish I was in Boston.
They aren't here.
I do not know.
Please iron the shirt.
Yesterday was my birthday.
That boy over there looks about the same age as you.
I can speak many African languages.
He was happy being a Jew.
I was out for a walk.
For whom will you vote for president?
Try this!
He kissed me and then I slapped him.
Isn't it scary?
I was in the mountains.
Tom never goes to places like that.
Is there a McDonald's near here?
Do you live here?
What happened to Tom's parents?
The jets took off one after another.
Did you get Tom's message?
He proposed that we should start at once.
We were prisoners.
I knew I'd seen it before.
I always go to the beach.
That's what I've ordered.
I hope you'll find what I'm searching for.
The river is widest at this point.
The bridge is low.
How come you know so much about Japanese history?
My mother doesn't like the heat of summer.
He proposed that we should start at once.
I am off duty tomorrow.
He's young and healthy.
He came late, as is often the case with him.
We're finding it difficult deciding on which one to buy.
We're looking for Tom now.
Let me go my own way.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Tom and I are the only ones still here.
If you're looking for a job, call me.
Good morning!
Excuse me.
Translating this poem is too much for me.
I can't see my dad.
I asked Tom to call you.
Thanks for the support.
Few people have two cars.
In this game, players were not allowed to kick the ball.
I ate too much.
I want some food.
I'm at a loss for words.
Why don't you both give up?
She saw the file.
They already know.
You must be so proud of her.
We have made friends with Tom.
Stay with Tom in this room.
My mother thinks of everything in terms of money.
We went to New York by plane.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Didn't you see Tom at the party?
I don't have any money.
If Tom is really alive, where is he?
I didn't know you were from Boston, too.
This isn't your fault, Tom.
I thought you were serious.
We have a kid.
Tom doesn't know how to treat his employees properly.
He loves fishing.
That's true, isn't it?
Tom laid the racket on the ground.
I don't think Tom has met Mary yet.
Their flag is blue and gold.
It's not going to happen to Tom.
What a lazy teacher!
Tom must be winning.
Now you do it.
I don't know.
Tom used to be lazy.
Do whatever's required.
John sent me a letter written in German.
He was set free after doing five years in prison.
Who did you kill?
I'll try to explain it to the best of my ability.
Tom couldn't suppress his anger.
What else do you need?
You gave up.
They continued walking.
That doesn't seem right.
She is a well-known singer.
The Kamo runs through Kyoto.
Hello? Are you still here?
Tom doesn't seem tired at all.
Workers lost their jobs.
I think we've eaten enough.
Don't get lost.
What are you looking for?
Let's go!
He showed me how to use this camera.
Me, too.
I am interested in books.
Take the one you like best, whichever it is.
We reported his disappearance.
Thanks for the inspiration.
You'll soon get used to eating Japanese food.
Are you hungry?
We hope Tom sticks around for a couple of weeks.
We know her.
He said I don't get enough sleep.
Where are you going to?
It cannot be true.
Thanks for the support.
I clean up my room every Sunday.
He left the room without so much as saying good-bye to me.
Do you want me to call Tom?
Would you like something to drink?
They can change.
Tom probably won't even notice that Mary isn't here.
Trousers of today sit much lower on the waist than they did centuries ago.
It's not only Tom that has to study. I have to study, too.
They all rose.
There are no flowers growing on Mars.
How will you manage without a job?
What do I tell her?
She is a well-known singer.
Let's do it.
She must be angry.
Can we really afford that?
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Do you know her?
We really do want to help them.
Your watch seems to be very valuable.
You're probably right, Tom.
Give me a ride home.
We have been in Paris.
You won't believe this!
I promise not to tell them.
Yaguatí likes swimming in the river.
Hurry up, or we'll be late.
Tom hasn't written to me in a long time.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
He said he could do it.
Are you going to do that again?
They entered cautiously.
It looks like Tom was right.
Tom can barely speak.
Tom obviously feels very passionate about this.
I spent all day yesterday with her.
Learn to write.
What time did you shut the shop?
He proposed that we should start at once.
They both work.
I'll tell her you came by.
If Jason should call me, tell him I'm not in.
Where is my dog?
I was up all night reading.
I don't have a cat.
I watched the birds on the balcony while drinking my coffee.
We made use of the maps during our journey.
How do you say that in Italian?
They already knew.
What street is this?
I didn't like what Tom gave me.
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history?
I bought the book which the children need.
Tom doesn't eat a lot of meat.
It was his fault.
Lisa speaks not only English but also French.
Let's look in the closet.
The girls don't like that song.
I wonder what became of them.
There were no laws for people to abide by.
I want Tom to read this.
To translate is to betray.
The boy was accompanied by his parents.
I'm as old as you.
A glass of water, please.
Maybe we can talk to her.
Thank you.
I read a lot.
The public is requested not to litter in these woods.
They don't listen.
Life begins at forty.
You should report this to the police.
I thought that only I had thought of that.
Tom's not a bad kid.
They both smiled.
This is what'll happen.
This is your bag, isn't it?
What was the violation?
Why do you stay with them?
I'm not a doctor.
The babies are screaming.
There are as many museums as there are churches.
Isn't it remarkable?
Tom escaped from his cell.
I just don't know what to say.
I might be able to help her.
I'm going to miss being a teacher.
Are you hungry?
How to say it?
This is Mary's dog.
They found us.
Don't handle my books with dirty hands.
How could she have known?
They all looked.
The city wants to extend the road.
Let's discuss that problem tomorrow.
I can't authorize that.
I'll call you back later.
Tom's patience has run out.
Can you drive a car?
They want to know what's happening.
I don't want them to take advantage of me.
Did you get Tom's message?
What have you taken?
Don't you hear that?
Open your eyes.
Are you at home, too?
Can I help you?
This discovery will be recorded in history.
That car is really expensive.
What does Tom eat for a mid-afternoon snack?
Tom finished doing the dishes.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You must be so proud of him.
It's big!
Could you find a room for my sister?
Should we wait for you?
I always have an uncomfortable feeling.
I can't fix the seat.
Would you come our house?
Show me what you're capable of.
How are you going to stop them?
Friends do things together.
I forgot to tell Tom I wasn't planning to be there.
She shut herself up in her room.
We're flying above the clouds.
Naomi has just finished her work.
Mary probably knows I like her.
They arrested him.
He comes here every five days.
Tom is in recovery.
My little sister is scared of all doctors.
I have to get home before it gets dark.
I don't want 2013 to end.
Are your parents going to be home?
This is a big mistake.
Please write down what I'm about to say.
I don't want them to take advantage of me.
That's what everyone says.
My mother thinks of everything in terms of money.
It was a gift.
Take the medicine.
Do you have to rent a car?
I'm tired of living this kind of life.
This is important to them.
I was a teacher.
The password is "Muiriel."
I am selling my goats.
The mob gathered round the car like so many flies.
He can speak not only English but also German.
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old.
What are you doing?
Tom doesn't have to be at today's meeting.
They all smiled.
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while.
She wept when she heard the terrible news.
He graduated from high school this spring.
What do you like about it?
Tom doesn't like me much.
Did you say anything to him?
Tom took his headphones off.
They came back.
Who told him to do that?
Do you remember me?
The bottle is full.
Solitude is the school of wisdom.
Where do you think all the money goes?
I have a fear of the dark.
I'm old, but I'm not that old.
Do we have to pay anything?
The Martians have conquered the earth.
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
I'm sure you're very busy.
They don't help.
I'm going to miss being a teacher.
I love you.
I've heard this song before.
Do you like apples?
Tom eats too fast.
They believe it.
I also like candy.
Tell Tom Mary's on the way.
What did we do to each other?
Happy New Year!
Something is better than nothing.
I have to wake Tom up soon.
Spring has come early this year compared with last year.
Tom peeked out the door to see what was happening.
You have told Tom the truth, haven't you?
Does anybody have a problem with this?
Nobody called him.
Tom is allowed to do that.
Tom worked until late at night.
Tom moved the flower pot to the left and the secret door slid open.
We urged Tom to go.
Tom may be back.
She saw the file.
I saw him just now.
You know her, I think.
Would you like another helping of potatoes?
I spoke with my family.
Thank you for your support.
I need to work.
I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.
Tom told me to give this to Mary.
This isn't my fault, is it?
Whose bag is this?
Did you see something?
A new idea came to me.
Fresh vegetables are very dear in winter.
It rained hard last night.
I am free of debt.
The bridge is high.
Tom doesn't have a home.
They continued eating.
I am happy.
They will change it.
We don't want her to leave.
How many moons does Mars have?
She was educated by her grandfather.
They all gasped.
They found Tom.
She treats me as if I were a stranger.
It's a dictionary.
The window was wide open.
Are you married?
This is the next one!
They all drank.
You're still young.
Where can we meet you?
Do you know much about that?
Tom lives on a farm in California.
You won't believe this!
Tom drank too much.
What does Tom eat for lunch?
Where is the bathroom?
I have a lot of credit cards.
Let's open it.
I know you are rich.
Tom and I used to play tennis together.
He is not kind to her.
All that glitters is not gold.
Do you know the answer?
One language is never enough.
What did you call me in here for?
He failed the entrance exam.
Tom didn't go to the hospital.
Should I call the doctor?
Let's not go.
Tom is swimming.
This movie is really scary.
I love teaching kids Spanish!
I will tell it to him at the proper time.
Did I say I was finished?
She cut down a tree.
All my friends like you.
Can you come?
Tom is watching TV now.
The mistake hastened his retirement.
Stand up!
What he says is very true.
I put it back.
They're here to protect him.
Did Tom go home?
I know it's impossible.
Why are you crossing the street?
I think you know what we have to do.
They came in.
Tom doesn't know Mary is here.
Thank you very much!
It was freezing.
Did you know Tom was seeing someone else?
Everyone likes him.
What is your name?
I talked to her on the phone.
Call the police!
Now, take a deep breath.
Thanks for the opportunity.
Their flag is blue and gold.
Tom is connecting his phone to the Internet.
Come along with us.
Perhaps you should get one.
You'll go to school tomorrow.
It's too expensive!
He is not a physician.
How do you plan on paying for that?
They can wait.
They didn't answer.
Who doesn't like the beach?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
They exchanged gifts.
Summer is almost over.
Can you get her?
Where are you from?
What good is beauty?
Trousers of today sit much lower on the waist than they did centuries ago.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his children.
We have plans.
John sent me a letter written in German.
Watch them closely.
I'm falling.
What became of him?
They'll ask her.
How many times have you gone?
Some people never listen.
What he said surprised me.
My name is Jack.
They made me go there.
I will be back soon.
We'll get another one.
Tom and I are both nervous.
Vegemite is a popular Australian foodstuff.
Excepting Sundays he works every day.
That's the crux of the matter.
How are you?
They believed Tom.
I've never flown before.
Tom wanted us to talk to you.
It's too large.
Don't worry!
Tom is deaf in one ear.
I'm proud of you.
You will have to go without her.
Don't worry.
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox?
Why don't you just let Tom help?
I don't remember where I put my car keys.
I think we should help them.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
You're going to tell us everything.
We close at 2:30.
Have they given you a nickname yet?
I need to buy some rat poison.
Do you speak Chinese?
Tom is the only person who can help me now.
I have no idea where Tom hid the money.
Tom was about to get into his car when he was shot.
Tom looks angry.
If anything happens, we'll be in in three seconds.
I was a teacher.
You can drive, can't you?
I need you.
We have not seen each other since our school days.
Tom should've asked Mary for help.
We had Tom paint the wall.
He called a taxi for me.
They all know.
He doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why.
This is never going to end.
I'll make it simple.
Your mom is here.
We're concerned about Tom's future.
Tom didn't want to live any longer.
We corrected it.
It's not my fault.
Where have you gone?
The news made him happy.
Do you live here?
Do we know you?
Enough!
Keep her away from us.
He will arrive on the afternoon of the 5th.
Please excuse my being late.
Tom doesn't feel like studying.
I can't stand your behaviour any more.
Did you lose something?
Answer the question.
He loves fishing.
Mary thinks I'm in love with her.
Get dressed quickly.
Use this.
I don't know where we'll arrive.
Do you live here?
I was a teacher.
It's a piece of cake.
That's the message.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
I was home all day yesterday.
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table.
Do all of you speak French?
She doesn't look like her mom.
I had some calls to make.
The children ran toward the classroom.
The children ran toward the classroom.
What should we do during our next vacation?
The bathroom's on the left.
