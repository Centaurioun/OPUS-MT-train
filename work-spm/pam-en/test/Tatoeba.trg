Our victory is secure.
The cook broiled the meat.
Can you predict the future?
They all left.
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.
A question is an answer.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I couldn't do this without your help.
You're the tallest person here.
Meg is excited.
When he arrived, I made coffee.
I believe you.
Look out of the window.
The monkey escaped from its cage.
Tom can't remember his kindergarten teacher's name.
I bought a book about animals.
Is it a recent picture?
Please close the door.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but there's something you should see.
They all giggled.
I cannot walk without a stick.
Don't ask.
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox?
"Tom's crying." "I know."
Suddenly, it began to rain.
The public is requested not to litter in these woods.
Much of what they wrote about never happened.
It was his fault.
The clock is defective.
How did Tom solve the problem?
My sister has three times as many books as I do.
I have to study for the exam.
She has a flower in her hand.
Tom knows time is running out.
How many people are on board the ship?
This is Mary's dog.
Can you see the woman standing behind Tom? That's Mary.
Why did you quit using Twitter?
Mary's neighbor is a busybody.
Tom got stuck in a traffic jam.
I have a friend who lives in Sapporo.
They all listened.
She decided to be a doctor.
I can hide everywhere.
What did you do to each other?
I think Tom did the best he could.
I'm going to miss being a teacher.
Shut up!
Get lost!
Termites are destroying the houses.
No one's going to see us.
Where is the dog?
Tom and Mary didn't invite me to their wedding.
Ever since his father died, David is very sad.
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here.
She doesn't listen to her parents.
I always go to the beach.
Tom had something in his hand.
He has left now.
I did it on purpose.
I cannot afford to buy a car.
Good morning!
It was her fault.
I'll loan you the money you want.
In a word, life is short.
Can we stop it?
You can do it.
I believe you.
You will have to go without her.
I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept.
We need Tom's strength now.
Are you ready?
I want to see you smile.
Spaghetti don't grow on trees.
What did Tom say about what happened?
We kissed each other.
I didn't ask them any questions.
That was unrealistic.
Do we need a Plan B?
I didn't trust him at first.
I wish I'd never told Tom that.
I don't know.
We arrived at the station at five.
We urged Tom to go.
It's time for the truth.
The sickness has weakened your organism.
I'd like to meet with her.
Yes.
The pain never went away.
No one respected men like him.
As he was about to leave, he said goodbye.
They continued working.
He is a mere child.
Listen to Tom.
You will do no such thing.
We will begin the meeting when Bob comes.
Do you believe in God?
This is very difficult for him.
Why would that be?
What's this?
I'm leaving early next week.
Let's do it!
Why didn't you tell him?
We'll tell Tom everything he needs to know.
He gets up at seven.
Should I ask them?
Do you speak Italian?
You have changed a lot.
The city wants to extend the road.
Is your mom home?
I'm gonna shoot him.
Do you speak English?
I didn't know Tom didn't understand French.
I'm about to get married!
Nobody understands me.
Natto is sticky.
I am more beautiful than you.
They called me.
We corrected it.
Nothing is impossible.
Tom doesn't know the truth.
Could you send me more information by email?
Tom came over to my house last night.
You won't find a dog bigger than this one.
We can't go right now.
It's not going to happen to Tom.
If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.
There are a million people in Auckland.
They executed Tom.
Nobody likes bad news.
That's a good-looking woman.
We haven't tried that yet.
They arrested her.
Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
How could he have known?
Our victory is secure.
They caught Tom.
I haven't found anything yet.
Take a look at that.
Tom is drinking water.
Tom's dirty clothes are on the floor.
Are you sure?
They are more active at night.
Tom is still at school.
Who are you talking about?
Tom kind of looks like John.
Did I write that?
Tell me again who will be helping us.
It is not safe for a girl to go out by herself so late at night.
The children's laughs spread throughout the forest.
They all screamed.
You can mix different foods in a blender.
He never visited her.
That was an evil bunny.
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
I know it's important to you.
I didn't know anything about this.
I don't understand.
I want to talk with Tom.
At last came the spring, with its warm sunshine.
I tried to get them to stop.
Tom doesn't appear to hear us.
Can you get her?
I was in the mountains.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
He plays very well.
He thinks that he's the centre of the universe.
I traveled to Italy last summer.
Did you know that?
I will lend you as much money as you want.
I'll give it to Tom.
Where does Tom live?
This was left on the porch.
Tom doesn't have long to wait.
Tom used to play the piano when he was younger.
I'm working in Tokyo now.
Tom gave it to us.
These are my shoes and those are yours.
If it had not been for civil war, they would be wealthy now.
Is this possible?
Tom is voting.
They went to an expensive restaurant for lunch.
He was asking about your health.
He plays very well.
There are islands in the sea.
May I borrow your dictionary?
I'm sure you're very busy.
Shall we go?
Can you get this trash out of here?
Tom took everything to his office.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
Tom went to Boston three years ago.
They continued searching.
Could you please turn the radio on?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
We have a son.
I live here.
I love you more than him.
I'll loan you the money you want.
They both giggled.
Is that edible?
You've told me that before.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
They don't care.
He is to come here at five.
The Pacific is the largest ocean in the world.
Why don't you like Tom?
Do you have a student fare?
They found us.
I translate into Esperanto for free.
They found nothing.
Almost all of us can speak French.
Every apple is red.
The store might be closed already.
I know your father.
Tom is connecting his phone to the Internet.
I refuse to let you marry that man.
My boss called me into his office.
That's just how I was raised.
You go first.
I couldn't sleep well last night.
Tom is a little taller than me.
I want you to follow me.
He wrote three books in as many years.
Who told her to do that?
He will get back from school.
It's not that big of a deal.
According to you.
I didn't know that you used to live in Boston.
That's enough.
Tom got here late.
I walk twenty miles a day.
They all stood.
They gave up.
Good evening.
Tom is driving to the hospital.
The matter was settled.
They're talking to him.
I am connecting this computer to the Internet.
Where is the toilet?
This plant has some burned leaves.
Tom has come to a decision.
Tom used to be lazy.
What's going to happen that's so terrible?
Many people shop here.
She treated him for a broken leg.
Hide that book.
Maybe you'd better call him.
I am entirely at your service.
This is kind of fun.
I have no home to live in.
When Tom drinks, everybody drinks.
She carried off all the prizes.
The new bridge is in process of construction.
I'll wait for you.
Tom seems discontented.
What's your son's name?
They aren't twins.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
She goes to the movies once a week.
How are you coming along with your French lessons?
This is the order.
He doesn't listen to his teachers.
Don't you want to see your kids?
Tom didn't kill anybody.
I'm here because of her.
Tom went into a corner and cried.
Have you seen this already?
Tom waited for Mary to come back.
This is a horse.
Thank you!
Tom is clueless.
She will return within an hour.
Do you believe in ghosts?
They all entered.
The bottle is empty.
Would you like something to drink?
We sometimes make mistakes.
I exercise because I want to stay healthy.
I wish I'd never told Tom that.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
She has lost her umbrella.
I don't want to go to school.
They bother me.
Tom wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
We are doing something.
Eternal love doesn't exist.
He earns three times as much as I do.
The whole plan is only based on his personal opinions.
The old man stood on the hill.
I hear he was released after five years in prison.
As a whole, the plan seems to be good.
Go away.
Don't worry. It won't take very long.
We listen to music.
They aren't rich.
I don't think we'll reach Boston before dark.
The wind died down by the evening.
I have a headache.
The old man stood on the hill.
Tom has a wife and three kids.
I don't know if I have the time.
Are we doing this?
He won't listen to me.
Is your watch correct?
Tom had a company to run.
He has nobody to consult.
I didn't want to appear hypocritical.
She carried off all the prizes.
They finished eating.
I have to find out when Tom plans to leave.
I can't live without you.
How are you going to stop them?
I don't think my gift meant very much to Tom.
Why don't we order pizza?
It was Tom who told me what had happened.
A baby craves its mother's milk.
Can you wait about an hour?
I have some questions to ask, but I don't want to bother you now.
There's fresh bread and water here.
You don't know a thing about me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
Why don't you want to come with us?
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.
They decided to settle in a suburb of London.
Is my explanation clear?
Can't you go by yourself?
It was really embarrassing.
He said, "Leave me alone."
India's Independence Day is celebrated on the fifteenth of August.
He made no response.
He died yesterday.
I was in bed all day long yesterday.
They both died.
Must I clean the room?
So what?
Tom won't be that easy to convince.
I want to go.
I told them they didn't have to do anything.
First, let us talk about the experiments conducted in laboratories.
In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.
He's young and healthy.
We've been wondering where you've been.
Nothing is as precious as love.
He doesn't have a sister.
You're in better shape than I am.
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
He refused to shake hands with me.
I'll go and ask Tom.
The answer was right in front of me.
Tom was blinded.
They exchanged smiles.
He doesn't listen to his parents.
Don't tell him.
I always forget that I already logged in.
This is my Japanese friend.
They aren't stupid.
I was disappointed in you.
Let me explain.
We looked down at the beautiful sea.
I'm not frightened of ghosts.
Please explain the rules of soccer to me.
Bob has the habit of going to bed at 10:00.
It's phenomenal.
It's a waste of time.
Do you study English?
We were prisoners.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
Tom and Mary split up after their son died.
They arrested him.
What did you do to each other?
I don't want to work under these conditions.
My room is always clean.
My goal is to become a doctor.
Maybe it's a good thing Tom isn't here.
I have to go to bed.
There were few children in the classroom.
The more people you know, the less time you have to see them.
He isn't alone anymore.
It is said that she is a good cook.
In the mountain area, snow has fallen more than fifty centimeters deep.
He always told me the truth.
Are you a student?
Is this Tom's wife?
Aren't you going to dance?
I left my shoes at school.
How old are you?
The leaves change color in autumn.
Tom didn't recognize her.
I like milk more than juice.
Who are you waiting for?
They're waiting for it.
You look stupid.
Ask him.
I wish school would disappear forever!
Help!
How do I get to the other side?
Tom thinks that I was in Boston last week.
You're the one who brought me here.
We disputed for hours about what to write.
He is a teacher apart from the rest.
This'll only take a minute.
I didn't even know that you used to live in Boston.
They might be able to help you.
Tom was at the gym for three hours yesterday.
Nobody knows that I have bought a new car.
Why are you checking Mary's mailbox?
Tom took some money out of the drawer.
Can we talk about this later?
His wife was killed in the accident.
I make lunch every day.
Hurry up.
You all remember Tom, don't you?
He is eager for success.
So what does it mean?
I'll tell her you came by.
I've got her with me.
They both screamed.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
Please excuse my being late.
He proposed that we should start at once.
Are you mad?
No one here pays.
Take things a little more seriously.
I've been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
I know it's impossible.
There was a lot of students absent from class today.
There are 50 members in the club.
I think Tom died.
Show him what you're capable of.
Tell them it's not your fault.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
You're a strong person.
Is it safe now?
The government was earning more money than it needed.
I pushed Tom into the water.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
Everyone is anxious to know what has become of the former champion.
I don't speak Japanese.
My father came back from Osaka last week.
He's not the same man he used to be.
I don't even know what Tom's last name is.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
I asked for grape juice.
This isn't my fault, is it?
I don't blame you.
Tom came in and handed Mary an envelope.
Take a bus.
Tom wasn't listening to Mary.
What are you shaking your head for?
It could rain tonight.
It's just a fantasy.
Have you ever had your fortune told?
Congratulations!
Really?
I didn't trust her at first.
Stay with Tom for a moment.
The cop went through his pockets, but found nothing.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I want to buy a dozen doughnuts.
I saw Joe last Sunday.
Quick, hold onto this tree.
We're going to be late for the concert.
If you work too long without a rest, it begins to tell on you.
We sometimes make mistakes.
Don't tell my wife.
This is my life's ambition.
How many more pages do you have left to read?
Next time you come to see me, I will show you the book.
I, too, like candy.
Didn't you see Tom at the party?
Do you think Tom knows how to get there?
They bought it.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
He doesn't listen to his teachers.
Fancy to eat at my place?
Tom has green eyes.
Tom may have been there. I don't know.
They arrested Tom.
Tom has a moustache.
We were retreating.
I like candy.
I am connecting this computer to the Internet.
Tom waited in front of the house.
I came here to play soccer.
Where do you live?
Tom doesn't really mean that, does he?
I got to know my current girlfriend at the gym.
In a word, it's ridiculous.
You can tear the box open.
They captured Tom.
Have you seen Tom's passport?
I don't like it either.
Let's get it open.
Merry Christmas!
We won the battle.
They believe you.
