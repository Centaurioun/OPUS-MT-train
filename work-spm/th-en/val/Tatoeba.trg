Food arrived on the table.
What do you want?
You're my woman.
Tom said Mary didn't think John really did that.
How many close friends do you have?
Let's go!
Is your watch correct?
Hi.
Those are my things.
Does the error occur regularly or sporadically? Is the error reproducible?
You are in my way.
She walks.
What school do you go to?
Is it raining?
Relax.
I have to go to sleep.
We've gotten a lot of positive feedback.
I am boiling water.
Tom likes it there.
Stop Tom.
Turtles don't have teeth.
I bow to the boss in greeting, and he returns my bow with a nod.
You seem busy right now.
What's her name?
No way!
Goodbye!
That won't happen.
Hello, world!
Did you see the sunrise earlier? It was really beautiful.
Koala bears do not have belly buttons.
I want you.
I am eating an apple.
Most of us want to do that.
Only Tom would have the guts to do that kind of thing.
I've lived here since 2013.
Have a seat.
I can see the target.
I've done a lot of skating.
I would rather stay home than go out.
I love you.
Thanks!
He has bought a new car.
Show me.
Santa lives at the North Pole.
In order to do that, you have to take risks.
Mum and Dad aren't coming with me.
You were made by God for a purpose.
Where does he live?
Tom says he wants to do that.
The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.
She had matured into an excellent woman.
Most people think I'm crazy.
He used to collect beetles when he was a kid.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
While we were on holiday, a neighbor took care of our cat.
You should sleep.
Get a life!
Is it yours?
I am Brazilian and I don't know any language except my own.
I'm going to miss Tom.
She fought until the end.
There is a bookstore in front of the department store.
You're boring me!
Stop grumbling.
I'm so fat.
I want your love.
What did you say?
Two months ago I did work experience in a factory.
I don't go to school.
What did you buy?
Did you find out anything about Tom?
Help me.
Is that what you said?
Life is beautiful.
If you respect yourself, then others will respect you.
There are islands in the sea.
I will go there even if it rains.
Flowers bloom.
I have a new bicycle.
It's mine.
Isn't that what I said?
I'm going to Berlin to visit my friend.
He was poor for a long time, but he is well off now.
Why don't you listen to Tom's advice?
We're kidding.
Warn Tom.
Admitting what you say, I still think you are wrong.
I am a man.
He knows nothing.
Hi, my name is Tom.
Trust me!
He believed they were destroying it.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Tom told me I shouldn't wear a pink shirt.
Turn on the radio.
She's not as shy as she used to be.
I live here.
These are for you.
I quit.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
She translated a poem.
How old are you?
The soldier never got scars from battles.
Is this the book you're looking for?
Happy birthday!
The soup's too hot, I can't eat it.
No, the houses in my village aren't tall, but the gardens are big.
I go shopping every morning.
I'm not going to say that.
I prefer not to talk about it.
My work is just beginning.
I can't eat this.
It's so expensive!
You're in better shape than I am.
When is the next guided tour?
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
Speak up!
Food finally arrived on the table.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
If you respect yourself, others will respect you.
Please, do come in. The door is open.
What has brought you here so early?
Let's play!
I'm staying.
I was accustomed to hard work.
I like to eat apples.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
I'm sorry I can't go.
I can't go.
Flip a coin.
We'll be OK.
Where did you go to in Australia?
I don't have any money.
Get a life.
What does Tom want to do?
Thanks to you, I arrived on time.
She said goodbye.
Tom lied.
Smile.
Have a look.
The beach isn't far from here.
Are you Tom's mother?
Find a job.
I'm not at all tired.
You should not break your promise.
Take a nap.
I own a car.
I can't go.
We will eat lunch together at 12:30.
Drive carefully.
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
This is it.
I fainted.
I don't know who to consult with.
I'm not going to do that.
I'm a cop.
Two young boys are carrying a load of water on a pole.
This is my computer.
It's just imaginary.
I don't understand.
Every problem has a solution.
How long did you stay?
Everyone liked him.
I love you more than you love me.
You cannot compare the strength of a man to that of a tiger, but nevertheless, the tiger is still the inferior creature.
I agree.
Tom lies.
Where is your school?
Has he come?
I want to play.
I'm going to study French for one semester.
Perfect!
Can you keep a secret?
He is proud that he is an artist.
Did your husband have many enemies?
Do you live here?
In the worst case scenario we'll just have to look as happy as we can.
Too late.
Are you married?
Tom didn't do the dishes.
If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Get out!
Got it!
I had a cat.
This will cost â‚¬30.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
The password is "Muiriel."
I don't agree with you.
It's a doll.
We'll have to go about it with care.
He has a lot of money.
That's why she wanted to meet him.
He left his team as he could not get along with the manager.
Are you sleepy yet?
You have lovely breasts.
You run.
It's a bit strange to me.
I am single.
What time did Tom say he'd come?
What for?
I know!
Everybody must know.
I try.
I'm a pro.
Wonderful!
Tom drove Mary to the airport.
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
How many hours left till arrival?
It seems to me that Tom is too careless.
We should celebrate.
A mouse is not a large animal.
That book is mine.
Are you really that desperate?
I want to do better next time.
Don't be so glum about it. Life has its ups and downs.
I have a headache.
January 1st is the day when many Japanese go to shrines.
He kept his promise.
Get a job.
I have a lot of work that still needs to be done.
Shopping malls are quickly mushrooming in this very urban city.
They will wait for us.
Go to school.
I lost.
It's me.
Tom is always so negative about everything.
Will you let me use your telephone, please?
Doesn't Tom want to do that?
She begged him to stay.
You look very pale.
Help!
Smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage.
It's time to wake Tom up.
I'm writing a letter.
You should sleep.
This is a comfortable chair.
I've been focusing on that.
Are you happy?
Yesterday, the weather was very nice.
Unbelievable!
I thought he was my brother.
Could you call again later, please?
I go to school.
I'm free tonight.
Leave me alone!
Attack!
It's raining.
We'll eat lunch together at 12:30.
Save Tom.
In Japan, people become legally of age at twenty.
