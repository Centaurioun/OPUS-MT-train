Tom said he would help me.
Have you ever been to America?
Lie still.
Examine this.
Come soon.
Tell me.
Do you know Tom's last name?
You need to sign that.
Tom had often heard about Mary, but hadn't yet met her.
We survived.
Keep practicing.
Take this.
As soon as he arrived at the airport, he phoned his office.
See you.
Open up.
Everyone dies.
They lost.
Stop reading.
Forgive me.
Sign this.
Everyone noticed.
Tom grinned.
Never mind!
Tom doesn't know how to say what he wants to say in English.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Start now.
Well, that's different.
Birds fly.
It helps.
Keep talking.
I punched Tom in the face.
The towels are dirty.
Years passed.
Tom is with his mother.
Somebody intervened.
Hand it to me.
Beat it.
I started thinking about Tom.
Tell me.
I do not sing.
Hurry home.
Defend yourself.
You're talkative.
It was terrific.
Come in.
I confessed.
Catch him.
Stay down!
Please specify any conditions you have for the use of this information.
Please don't use my name.
Do you want to see what I just made?
Stop fighting!
Stay down!
Tom won.
Tom isn't my client.
Wake up!
I couldn't understand his ideas.
Google Translate can't translate phrases or give definitions of individual words.
Love lasts.
I'm not tired.
That aircraft company deals in freight only.
See you at school.
Examine it.
Keep that.
Stay back.
He shaves four times a week.
We failed.
Stop pushing.
Stop it.
Look again.
Keep walking.
One day, you will understand.
Show yourself.
Ask Tom.
Keep notes.
I'll go to the hospital.
Sleep tight.
Stay here.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Keep quiet!
Anybody hurt?
Tom tried to stop me.
Keep away.
By the way, where are you from?
Be still.
Be discreet.
Anybody home?
We've arranged everything.
Tom asked Mary for some money so he could buy something to eat.
It happened.
Do you have any objection to this plan?
I love you.
Keep fighting.
Warn Tom.
Open up.
What's your number?
I hate opera.
They tried.
Look away.
It gave her quite a shock, and she didn't want to talk about anything for a while. I think it'll be a while before she's back to normal.
Please stay.
I still believe you cheated me.
They understood.
Loosen it.
Keep running.
There are islands in the sea.
Stay focused.
I don't know what more I can do for you.
That will change nothing.
We try.
I am a vegetarian.
They stopped.
Don't do it, Tom.
When do you shop?
Tom accepted the proposal without reservation.
I don't have time to talk with you anymore.
Flowers bloom.
Do you have someone in mind for the job?
You should know that I'm in love with Mary.
She was in a hurry to go home.
Tell everybody.
Eat everything.
Stop shooting.
Hug me.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
Look closer.
I have just what you need.
The weather is good today.
When do you shop?
Everyone's up.
Start again.
I don't know why Tom didn't come and I don't want to ask him.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Happy Thanksgiving!
We've been waiting.
Tom lost.
Please don't use my name.
Please let me help.
Start writing.
Keep trying.
That hurts.
Step forward.
Sit there.
I've decided to say yes.
I drink tea, too.
The bread is fresh.
Anything else?
Turn right.
I absolutely cannot approve the proposition.
Sit here.
Be cool.
Get out.
Release him.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Step aside.
Try hard.
Leave it.
Put your gloves on.
Go ahead.
I can't remember what I ate last night.
Stop worrying.
Look there.
They laughed.
Call us.
Tom called.
Everything changes.
Be punctual.
Fill the pot with water.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
Wait beside the car for me!
If aspirin will ease my headache, I will take a couple tonight instead of this horrible medicine.
Stop staring.
Too late.
Hand it to me.
That worked.
How cute!
Welcome.
She disappeared.
It was vague.
Tom's room was very small.
Stay still.
They burned.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I resigned.
My hovercraft is full of eels.
Start over.
I fainted.
Please sit.
Why didn't you write me?
She brushed away the dust.
Keep writing.
You're the leader.
Come here.
Seize him!
Stand up!
Tom helped.
Stop reading.
This book includes a variety of foods and their important facts related to health.
All Tom wanted was to find a woman who would accept all the love he had to give.
Work while you work, play while you play.
Speak up!
How cute!
Stop yelling.
Contact Tom.
Tom can go hear Mary sing at that club whenever he wants to.
Be still.
Don't forget the ticket.
See you at work.
Take command.
I resign.
You should know that I'm in love with Mary.
Tom stood there, waiting to cross the busy road.
The fastest runner can't run 100 meters in 9 seconds.
I am happiest when I am reading.
Be serious.
I had finished my homework when you called me.
Beef, please.
I lost.
Tom wanted to sleep late, but was unable to.
Did you stay here all night?
Congratulations!
By the way, what is the matter with him?
Keep walking.
Wait beside the car for me!
I'm an engineer.
Start here.
How about going to the movies?
Be fair.
He glanced at his watch.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Be kind.
Tom disappeared.
They struggled.
Welcome.
Tom didn't give further details.
Get down!
Are they doing anything right now?
Speak up!
Good luck.
Everyone prayed.
Tom overslept.
It's cold.
Coffee, please.
She should have followed Mary's advice.
I need to know how this happened.
I read a book while eating.
Tom drinks.
I'll come by car.
They screamed.
Excuse me.
Just relax.
I am very happy in Georgia.
I said some things I didn't mean.
Everybody paid.
We're going to have fun.
Get started.
I can't be late.
When did you tell me?
They walked.
When did you tell me?
Quiet, please.
Thanks.
This is the biggest car in the world.
Wood floats.
Anyone home?
It's great fun.
I don't care what you do with it.
You lied to us, didn't you?
Return immediately.
Shove over.
I miss you.
Take these.
No further details were available.
Be creative.
Tom introduced me to Mary.
You run.
Keep focused.
Get moving.
Please stop.
Memorize this.
Start singing.
Tom and Mary walked down the busy sidewalk.
I drink water.
Get up.
I'm not a doctor.
Stop complaining.
I'm drinking milk.
Everyone waited.
Come soon.
She walks.
Keep paddling.
Be cool.
Go ahead.
Something changed.
You seem like a nice kid.
Tom told me he didn't take French in high school.
Hold this.
I hear that Tom Jackson is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary treats her dog.
Continue digging.
Tom came back inside the room.
Tom suggested that I go to a movie with Mary.
How touching!
That worked.
We'll have a great time in Boston.
Say goodbye.
Stop moving!
Watch yourself.
Tom gloated.
Things break.
Be seated.
Wood burns.
Tom does love you.
Stop that immediately.
I exercised.
Do you think I should do this?
The cake I made was not eaten by you, it was eaten by your sister.
Hello, Tom.
Ask anyone.
I should've gone after Tom.
Tom fought.
That works.
Call home!
Hello, Tom.
Get ready.
Tom worked at a hospital.
Beat it.
Cuff him.
Have you ever been to America?
Take mine.
Welcome to Wikipedia.
My knife is sharp.
I laughed.
Stop talking.
I don't know anything about this.
That hurts.
Cool off!
I want to start over.
Keep still.
The house is small.
You're the leader.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Follow me.
Someone coughed.
Thank you.
You tried.
Tom drowned.
Tom clapped.
We'll have troubles for sure.
Start counting.
Stop pushing.
What do you suggest I do?
Please proceed.
Can you tell me who is coming tonight?
They waited.
Merry Christmas!
Stop laughing.
Tom was relieved to hear that.
I contributed.
Keep calm.
Hop in.
Take it upstairs.
Tom gasped.
What are you stopping for?
Mr Yoshida is at home in French history.
They danced.
Forgive me.
I recovered.
Tom laughed.
The book is on the table.
I spoke to Tom last night.
That works.
Go ahead!
Tom groaned.
Tom shaved.
Stay here.
I didn't need Tom.
Tom moaned.
Tell me.
Nice timing.
How old is your dog?
Keep smiling.
Tom swims better than Mary does.
Sleep tight.
Take it upstairs.
Stop yelling.
I can do the math.
Keep trying.
Tom should've asked Mary for help.
Anybody here?
Show yourself.
Take it.
When did you tell me?
I'm a doctor. How about you?
Nobody asked.
Tom knits.
Stop complaining.
Tom insisted.
Have you ever gone to Paris?
How beautiful!
Stop there.
Be reasonable.
Everyone screamed.
Tom reads French better than I do.
Get dressed.
I still believe you cheated me.
Tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it.
Stay focused.
Tom is an extremely good-looking man.
You're not good at this.
Tom recovered.
Take over.
Please come and get me.
Eat something.
Come over.
Say hello.
Nobody called.
Cheer up!
This is my choice.
Tom advised Mary to leave as soon as possible.
We overslept.
Where are the books?
Get changed.
Hold on.
Tom arrived just in time.
Listen carefully.
Hold this.
Eat everything.
I'm glad to see you back.
Be careful.
Please stay.
They left.
Say something.
Be patient.
Do you have any objection to this plan?
Look out!
Yes, she's our manager.
I like to feel sad. I know that most people try to avoid any kind of sad feeling. But I think that is wrong.
The decision has been made.
Stay here.
Get down!
Tom liked Australia.
Thank God.
Ticket, please.
Is that a real diamond?
Melanie is eating an apple.
Stay focused.
Your pitching is far superior to mine.
Keep working.
Oh no!
Stay still.
Try again.
I deserve more.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Find Tom.
Drive carefully.
Oh no!
Stop whining.
Finish this.
Turn this way.
How can you not know?
Are you lucky?
What color did Tom dye his hair?
Tom grumbled.
Come back.
Tom isn't homeless.
Kiss me.
How perceptive!
Humor me.
"What's wrong?" "My computer just crashed."
I drink tea, too.
Examine it.
Tom blinked.
Tom provided no further details.
Tom hesitated to discuss the subject with Mary.
Grab that.
Say cheese.
Start over.
I'd like to sit by the window.
Not bad.
Forget it!
I exercised.
Tom came home early yesterday.
Be cool.
Keep fighting.
I disagree.
Be realistic!
She smiled.
Forget about Tom.
They walked.
Be respectful.
I haven't heard from him since last June.
Tom visits Mary every time he's in Boston.
Congratulations!
Is there a man in your life?
Tom called.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Think again.
They yelled.
That's true, too.
Please hurry.
Finish this.
Shove over.
What is your favorite bird?
Come back.
Tom said that he'd be a few minutes late.
Be creative.
Say cheese.
Stay away.
Hold this.
What are they waiting for?
They smiled.
Tell her that I am sleeping.
Tom really respects you.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
You should know that I'm in love with Mary.
Stand back!
She's afraid of the dark.
Everyone stood.
Stop shooting.
They crashed.
They applauded.
Help me.
I waited.
Tom clapped.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Stay calm.
Step inside.
I want Tom killed.
Don't you get it?
Try some.
She left home with everything she owned.
Terrific!
They lied.
Stay there.
Tom will kill again.
Get away!
Ask Tom about it.
Where are you from?
Stay alert.
Please proceed.
Move quietly.
Tom and Mary are both very competent teachers.
Sweet dreams!
That worked.
Tom says it's OK.
I'm really disappointed in you.
Everybody left.
Tom gasped.
The reason why many language learners never become fluent is that they talk the walk more than they walk the talk.
Don't quibble about the details.
I can do the math.
Choose carefully.
Step forward.
Google Translate is not good enough for Ubuntu Translations. Furthermore, this is against Ubuntu policy.
Comfort Tom.
Join us.
Tom looked.
Watch us.
They vanished.
Tom is much stronger today.
The rooms are deserted.
Move quietly.
Don't you get it?
Someone called.
All the students study English.
Eat everything.
Happy anniversary!
Get my rifle.
I have two cats.
Take precautions.
Stop trying.
You're not good at this.
Keep talking.
He ran.
Keep down.
Tom does love you.
It stinks.
Tom called the neighbors.
It was vague.
We volunteered.
There's a good chance that Tom doesn't know what Mary has done.
Let me do my work in peace.
Keep out.
Stay still.
They lost.
Don't skip over any details.
Can you tell me who is coming tonight?
Are they doing anything right now?
Look away.
They agree.
The new subway enables me to get to school in 20 minutes.
Sign this.
Tom grinned.
She cried.
This box contains five apples.
Keep listening.
We promised.
Lighten up.
Add salt and baking soda to the water.
Really?
Who died?
Have fun.
Keep paddling.
Have you been listening to me?
They stood.
Tom cheats.
Get away!
What's wrong?
Study hard.
We survived.
Stay positive.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Tom finished.
Everybody knows.
Stay close.
We forgot.
Hold it!
Ask anybody.
Be content.
Calm down.
I see.
Stay put.
Wash up.
Keep reading.
Keep down.
Try again.
Tom volunteered.
These details won't be published.
I thought he was coming.
Put your gloves on.
We'll go back to Boston together.
I understood.
We lost.
The room is dark.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Wood burns.
Keep focused.
She wants to drink some warm milk.
Seventy or eighty years is the normal span of a man's life.
Come along.
Don't skip over any details.
Tom died.
Help yourself.
Keep dancing.
Nobody knows.
Who cares?
They tried.
Be prepared.
They fell.
Are you going to go on holiday this year?
Tom agreed.
The glass is clean.
I've never eaten horsemeat.
Tom started laughing.
We work together.
Tom turned and ran after Mary.
Tom snores.
She walks.
Please stop.
Take Tom.
Stay there.
Work slowly.
Keep reading.
All started to laugh.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
Look around.
Move over.
They called.
Be merciful.
He is twice as heavy as his wife.
Keep back.
Keep writing.
Smile.
Hurry up.
Try some.
The man sitting over there is a famous singer.
Study hard.
That won't change anything.
Show me.
Call home!
Stay cool.
Eat slowly.
Take control.
Wow!
Come forward.
How tragic!
Get inside.
You'd better back off.
Anyone hurt?
Hop in.
Louder, please.
Keep listening.
I overslept.
Why don't we go sit down?
We forgot.
Say please.
Forget about Tom.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Tom can't accept your gift.
Have you been listening to me?
Loosen up.
Keep warm.
Step back.
We hope to arrive on time.
You should know that I'm in love with Mary.
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
Stop pushing.
Take action.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Be ruthless.
Pardon me?
Say something.
Tom fainted.
They swam.
Do you want to see what I just made?
Please don't use my name.
This is going to hurt a bit.
They understood.
Don't go out after dark.
Tom drives.
Say nothing.
Examine this.
The map is on the wall.
Work slowly.
You're so intense.
Stop it.
Tom danced.
Stay together.
Leave me.
Tom left out no details.
Hold Tom tight.
Be confident.
Hands off.
Stop it.
Why did you stop me?
Tom is a runaway.
Mary giggled.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
Watch out!
I felt that he could teach me to read.
He came.
How beautiful!
Please relax.
Tom is friendly with Mary.
Use this.
Stay put.
Nobody came.
She cried.
Ask Tom.
Tom worked at a hospital.
I agree.
You're so intense.
They kissed.
Tom cried.
I will never forget this day.
Tom listened.
Tom swims better than Mary does.
Forgive us.
Forget him.
Stop squabbling.
Is it OK if I sit here?
Sit down!
Stop resisting!
Take everything.
Get up.
Mary ran.
Use this.
Tom is a very talented musician.
Help me.
Eat something.
I love you.
Tom is overdoing it.
Tom hesitated.
Sit here.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom definitely has our support.
Skip it.
Hello, Tom.
I am very happy in Georgia.
Everything changes.
Trust me.
Do you think I should do this?
Please sing.
I have not yet learned whether he reached there or not.
Smile.
Keep out.
Tom told Mary not to be late again.
Tom took Mary home.
They burned.
Tom exaggerates.
She tried.
We forgot.
Be punctual.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
Get down!
I know.
Listen.
It rained.
Hey, relax.
Tom saw Mary earlier this week.
The chairs are under the tree.
Take precautions.
Stay together.
Stop worrying.
The baby cried herself to sleep.
Tom is bragging about his new car.
Who did you send roses to?
Everybody smiled.
That helped.
I like apples best.
Hand it to me.
I've known Jim since I was a child.
They approve.
Congratulations!
She was ready to help him with washing the car.
I don't have any details.
Stand back!
We know.
He's not my boyfriend.
Can you speak French?
Be ruthless.
Tom hesitated.
Tom confessed.
Ask around.
They obeyed.
Get Tom.
I don't care what you do with it.
I like it here.
Keep working.
Feel this.
Please hurry.
Quit gambling.
Look out!
I know who that is.
It snowed.
We won.
Look here.
Take these.
Sign here.
Can you speak French?
Who did you send roses to?
Are they doing anything right now?
Follow Tom.
Be serious.
Come forward.
Come quick!
Do you really want to know the truth?
Something happened.
They left.
These things aren't mine!
It is raining.
We surrendered.
That'll change nothing.
My mother is beautiful.
Everything stopped.
Loosen up.
Come here.
Does this sound stupid?
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Get lost.
Stop that immediately.
Tom doesn't pay much attention to how he dresses.
Sit there.
Me, too.
Everyone changes.
Ghosts exist.
I miss you.
I don't care what you do with it.
I hope you enjoyed the long weekend.
Come quickly.
Creditors have better memories than debtors.
Stop crying.
Let's get a picture of us together for my mom.
Excuse me.
Come tomorrow.
Wake up!
Forget him.
Action!
Exercise outdoors.
Step aside.
That's your opinion.
Hurry up.
Stop babbling.
They relaxed.
Find Tom.
Happy birthday!
We hope to reopen soon.
You run.
Tom and Mary were exhausted.
Kiss me.
This is not important.
Be kind.
Someone screamed.
Stay calm.
Stop fighting!
Cheer up!
Welcome.
She smiled.
Please relax.
Try hard.
This will be easy.
Send it to me now.
Turn around.
You need to sign that.
Keep down.
I'm here for the meeting.
Let's stop beating around the bush and cut to the chase.
Please smile.
Watch carefully.
It was a pretty close call.
Never mind!
Somebody answered.
Look ahead.
Please don't use my name.
He's a man you can rely on.
Tom paid.
He was accused of stealing the jewels.
Hand it to me.
That works.
Everything matters.
Memorize this.
Everyone cheered.
Hug me.
Comfort Tom.
Tom has been warned more than once.
That's just my opinion.
I just want to be able to visit my children whenever I want to.
They applauded.
Hang on!
Let's stop beating around the bush and cut to the chase.
Nothing happened.
Stand aside.
I can't take it any more.
Look ahead.
Are they doing anything right now?
Ignore them.
We have all the details.
Tom cheated.
Nobody called.
The woman is in the room.
Quit gambling.
What's your name?
I lost.
Keep this.
Warn Tom.
Forget Tom.
Get started.
Choose one.
We're still the best.
It works.
Keep practicing.
Leave Tom.
You were supposed to wait.
Shut up!
It's an old name.
I know what's wrong with me.
Memorize it.
Hand me the briefcase.
Come outside.
What do you think of going to a movie?
Who won?
Tom jumped.
Hold this.
Be realistic!
They struggled.
Drive safely.
Tom wants a new car.
Cool down.
Tom blushed.
Never mind!
I can't be late.
It is a bird.
He speaks really well.
Come inside.
Start writing.
Take care.
We apologize.
I should've gone after Tom.
I failed the exam.
Somebody laughed.
I forgot.
Let us tell you why we came.
I am running in order to catch the train.
Are there any movie theaters near here?
Start running.
Stop trying.
Wake up!
According to my experience, it takes one year to master French grammar.
All I want is a chance to say I'm sorry.
Be cool.
How annoying!
Stand aside.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
Calm down.
I apologize.
He should be back any minute.
Everyone screamed.
Tom disappeared.
There are some children playing in the park.
Come over.
Please wait.
How deep?
Welcome home.
I must translate the sentences.
Watch yourselves.
Many of the workers had missing fingers.
I will try again.
There is a man working on the farm.
Drive slowly.
I apologized.
Watch closely.
Tom chuckled.
I can't let you do this.
Look back!
Your sweater's on backwards.
Follow Tom.
Tom cried.
How embarrassing!
Try again.
Tom answered.
How many years have you lived here?
My aim is to learn enough English so I don't need to carry a dictionary with me when I travel.
I think I left something in the classroom.
We are opposed to war.
Tom is a very private man.
Tom sighed.
Stand up!
We agree.
I'd never been to Boston before.
Stop it.
Start here.
Say please.
Who did you send roses to?
Well, that's different.
Tom begged us to be patient.
I remember.
Ask Tom.
Walk slowly.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was still just a boy.
Nobody volunteers.
Join us.
Get dressed.
Look out!
Be yourself.
I don't speak Japanese.
Stop reading.
We remember.
I've always wanted to read that book.
Stop complaining.
Tom died.
All I want is a chance to say I'm sorry.
Call home!
Stop yelling.
I stayed.
Everyone survived.
Please wait.
Release him.
How horrible!
The damage is done.
Enjoy yourself!
Leave tomorrow.
Please come.
Answer me.
Say please.
Ignore them.
Tom worked at a hospital.
Come home.
The home team won.
Please proceed.
Tom waved.
You can't do that. It's illegal.
Stay away.
Perfect!
I don't care what you do with it.
Why not?
They refused.
Be patient.
Come on!
I don't know whether Tom is hungry or not.
Sign here.
They escaped.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Nobody understands.
I understood.
Stay back.
Keep warm.
Keep back.
Keep reading.
It is a book.
Step aside.
Be specific.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
Good evening.
Be calm.
Think again.
At that time a primitive people lived there.
Keep down.
Can I leave a message, please?
Leave town.
The apple is on the table.
Are there any more details?
I don't care how much it costs. I'm going to buy it anyway.
You run.
They voted.
They embraced.
Leave me.
Happy holidays.
Take action.
One day, you will understand.
Look alive.
They screamed.
Stop it.
I think I know what happened.
I disagree.
Come in for a minute.
This isn't easy.
How lovely!
She's two years younger than him.
