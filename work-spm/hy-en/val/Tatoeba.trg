What happened?
What does a Sovietologist study?
Come on!
Be specific.
I resigned.
Stop crying.
What kind of books does Tom read?
Control yourselves.
Tom says it's OK.
It's not barcoded.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
Keep going.
Tom apologized.
Leave the door open.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be fair.
Wow!
Can you stop yelling?
Call me.
Cool down.
Tom listened.
Hold it!
That child's mother is a director.
That helped.
Tom would have liked to attend Mary's party. Unfortunately, he had other things he had to do.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Stop reading.
Please come.
Tom left.
Grab that.
I got a message from Tom.
I am glad that you have succeeded.
Keep running.
Tom is trying hard to give up smoking.
Tom gloated.
Drop it!
Say nothing.
They disappeared.
Hurry up.
We talked.
Stop grumbling.
Keep cool.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
Stop apologizing.
That's a frightening possibility.
It helps.
My aim is to learn enough English so I don't need to carry a dictionary with me when I travel.
Tom linked to my website from his blog.
Thanks.
Chris is very attractive and wealthy, but not very modest.
Trust me.
Stop resisting!
Be patient.
Step aside.
Come over.
Stop looking at that girl.
I said some things I didn't mean.
Look away.
Tom sounds perfect.
Everyone prayed.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
Calm down.
Be confident.
Did you stay here all night?
Tell me.
Tom laughed.
Sit tight.
Who should we give it to?
Skip it.
Goodnight!
This is my bicycle.
Tom dozed.
Please listen.
Tom entered the lobby and found Mary waiting.
You are absolutely right.
Tom sang better than Mary.
Get serious.
Turn right.
Please reconsider.
She tried.
Tom said I should talk to you.
We failed.
How strange!
Excuse me.
My mother is at home.
I began living by myself.
Ask Tom.
Unbelievable!
Keep fighting.
There is still snow in our country.
Be calm.
We lost.
That hurts.
They danced.
Stop crying.
Of course.
This is my choice.
Horses are bigger than dogs, but cats are smaller than dogs.
Now, what else can I do for you?
Tom doesn't know where he's going to live next year.
You do nothing else but eat.
They walked.
Stop pushing.
Tom shrugged.
It's not important.
We learn by experience.
Stop that!
Be reasonable.
Humor me.
I can't take it any more.
How many years have you lived here?
Thanks anyway.
Don't do it, Tom.
When do you shop?
Leave tomorrow.
I can't imagine such a life.
I don't know.
Start counting.
Please leave.
Seize him!
I misunderstood.
Nobody cares.
Tom has been warned more than once.
Stop there.
Love hurts.
There are many people in Asia.
They started hours ago.
Are you kidding me?
Let's get a little closer.
Do you love your mother?
Sing along.
Even the smallest child knows that kind a thing.
I still need to talk to Tom.
Listen.
Help yourself.
Try this.
Stay here.
Ask Alex.
Tom has come to help us.
Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died.
Tom fought.
Keep this.
Things changed.
Birds sing.
Keep it.
Tom nodded.
They walked.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Sure I can, although I can't really speak Shanghainese.
How many more of you are there?
Hand me the briefcase.
You are taller than she is.
I need to know how this happened.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's get a little closer.
Mary always wants Tom to talk about his feelings.
That ball could've hit me.
Who did you send roses to?
I feel like sleeping all day.
Listen.
Get serious.
Settle down!
We helped Tom the best we could.
Oh, hush!
Get down!
They hugged.
Come back.
What is your favorite bird?
Keep digging.
Keep cool.
Please come and get me.
Have we met?
I disagree.
I rescheduled.
Tom stood there, waiting to cross the busy road.
Ignore them.
Get out.
Tom looked Mary in the eyes.
We were up front.
Replace it.
Keep back.
Wait here.
Stop meddling.
I have just what you need.
Get inside.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
Tom hesitated.
Tom doesn't want to be seen talking to you.
Get everything.
I overslept.
Don't wait for us.
We volunteered.
Leave it.
Leave Tom.
Everyone dreams.
I'm sorry I took so long.
Keep smiling.
Follow us.
Take everything.
Grab this.
Keep walking.
It happened.
We forgot.
I should be able to do something about that.
I can't let you do this.
Everybody laughed.
Tom waited.
Does anybody know if the cafeteria is still open?
Be seated.
There are three campgrounds in this area.
Happy birthday!
Take control.
How interesting!
Be cool.
Tom exhaled.
Keep dancing.
Tom frowned.
Stop whining.
Straighten up.
I believe that you will succeed.
Let us tell you why we came.
Alice smiled.
Tom doesn't need to come yet.
Start again.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Watch us.
Get changed.
Have we met?
Smoke appeared.
I quit.
Memorize it.
Forget it!
You lied to us, didn't you?
Tom cried.
Tell everybody.
I panicked.
I live in Yerevan.
Do as I asked.
Be fair.
Turn this way.
Nobody cares.
Come back.
He accelerated.
After you.
Ask anybody.
Follow him.
They lost.
Of course!
I won!
I checked my watch and realized I was an hour early.
Walk slowly.
I don't want to go to school.
I don't dream.
We ought to get over there.
I am reading a book now.
Tom jumped.
Get everything.
Thank you.
Stop apologizing.
Stay still.
Do as I asked.
Of course!
Stop overreacting.
Tom has never been to my house.
Cuff him.
Can you stop yelling?
Come here.
Stay focused.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
Show me.
Who died?
Tom is bragging about his new car.
Everybody panicked.
Stay sharp.
The temperature has fallen below zero this morning.
I still believe you cheated me.
Tom coughed.
Ask around.
I find Tom very easy to talk to.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
You are taller than she is.
Loosen up.
They kissed.
Come in.
Stay down!
Healthy food is essential for a healthy body and a healthy mind, and as a result, promotes maximum efficiency.
You run.
Details are still being finalized.
Water is life.
Hang on!
Come quickly.
Do I have a knife?
Ignore Tom.
Stay down!
Wake up!
Stay close.
Tom didn't have to explain it to me.
Return fire.
Watch closely.
Do you know Tom's last name?
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
I can't remember what I ate last night.
I survived.
Choose carefully.
Bright picture.
What are you stopping for?
Help yourself.
Get real!
Tom tried to speak French to the saleslady.
I'm sorry I took so long.
Hold this.
Have you been listening to me?
Don't wait for us.
Stay awake.
I try.
Why didn't you write me?
Please listen.
Tom agrees.
Tom coughed.
I need to see Tom now.
The details really don't matter.
I quit.
You're talkative.
They cheat.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Who cares?
Tom yawned.
He is twice as old as I am.
Are you lucky?
Stay awake.
I like the Occitan language.
Leave town.
Why did you stop me?
You'd better back off.
Be attentive.
Please proceed.
They quarreled.
Everybody left.
Hold on.
How many years have you lived here?
Have fun.
Ghosts exist.
Write me.
Be punctual.
Tom added his own name to the list of people who wanted to take part in the dance.
It'll be wonderful.
Turn left.
Wow!
Try again.
Sit tight.
Things changed.
Somebody called.
Keep searching.
Turn left.
How many years have you lived here?
Take it.
Tom giggled.
Tom dozed.
Please continue.
Tom lost.
Stand up!
Be discreet.
Nobody answered.
I can't take it any more.
This works.
Take action.
Examine them.
Tom clapped.
I confessed.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Stay cool.
Speak clearly.
Come on!
They cheered.
Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
Ignore them.
Tom needs something.
I'll watch TV.
Get ready.
Marry me.
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow.
Get out.
Tom enlisted.
Tell Tom.
What's Tom reading?
Stop lying.
Too late.
Look alive.
Stop it.
What for?
Let's go drink a cup of coffee at that coffee shop over there.
I don't know what more I can do for you.
Be friendly.
That worked.
Ignore that.
What happened?
I disagree.
Tom graduated.
All aboard!
Defend yourselves.
What's wrong?
Memorize it.
New York is the biggest city in the world.
I see.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
Tom flinched.
Things change.
I abhor violence.
What do you suggest I do?
Tom drove.
Hold fire.
Go ahead.
Grab Tom.
Of course.
Don't skip over any details.
When I was a child, my mother made me eat green vegetables every day.
I am studying.
Money talks.
Forgive me.
Drive slowly.
My computer is expensive.
I improvised.
They called.
Follow me.
Stand aside.
Put your gloves on.
Stuff happens.
Just tell me why you're really here.
I volunteered.
Replace it.
Look alert.
I believed that he had no right to do that.
Come in.
Tom didn't go into detail.
Keep climbing.
Stop talking.
Exercise outdoors.
Somebody called.
I never saw you.
Tom is extremely creative.
Be patient.
What?
Leave everything.
What are they waiting for?
We failed.
Everyone smiled.
Stand aside.
Do you have a dictionary?
Thanks.
I don't like silence.
Stop gawking.
Stop arguing.
How curious!
You're entitled to your opinion.
Tom lied.
Ignore Tom.
Hello!
Be fair.
Quiet down.
Take over.
Stop smoking.
Sing along.
Tom should thank me.
Stop lying.
Be quiet.
Mama cried.
Who should we give it to?
Hurry home.
Tom used to be generous.
Keep away.
Now, what else can I do for you?
Calm down.
Continue working.
Yes.
Leave town.
Check, please.
Tom got killed in a freak accident.
I sympathize.
We'll do that.
One day, you will understand.
We know.
Hurry back.
Take action.
She cried.
Fill the pot with water.
Be nice.
Memorize it.
Watch me.
Someone came.
He tries.
It helps.
Stay away.
They canceled.
Watch us.
She got married last year.
Take cover!
We waited.
Follow him.
Tom gave Mary a ride home.
I'm not quite sure yet.
You can't do that. It's illegal.
Tom gave no other details.
Turn around.
How old is your dog?
You wouldn't be lying to me, would you?
Did you stay here all night?
I just ignore them.
Stop complaining.
That worked.
Grab him.
Tom called the neighbors.
Tom knows.
Stop here.
Tom is clearly upset.
Stand still!
They sweated.
Nobody remembers.
Drive faster.
I forgot.
We've arranged everything.
Look there.
Follow us.
How curious!
Tom knew better than to argue with Mary.
Eat everything.
Call home!
Get moving.
Ask Tom about it.
Look out!
Tom inhaled.
Stop babbling.
Speak clearly.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Keep climbing.
Hold fire.
Stop smoking.
Call me.
Tom would never wear a coat that looked like that.
Everybody knew.
Leave town.
My mother is at home.
Watch us.
Do you have plans tonight?
Tom chuckled.
Be content.
Anybody here?
Write me.
Drive on.
Can you speak French?
Hello, world!
Control yourself.
Tom quit.
Tom needs to know what he's up against.
Back off.
Enjoy yourself!
Look around.
I can't stand to think about it.
Get down!
She disappeared.
Do you have plans tonight?
Step back.
Come over.
Ignore Tom.
Return immediately.
How thrilling!
You can't make it without me.
Stay sharp.
Ignore Tom.
Stop it.
You tried.
Look closer.
Not bad.
I promise.
Keep singing.
Stand by.
Just relax.
Loosen up.
Save yourself.
Stop trying.
Everybody cheered.
Keep walking.
I remember.
Visitors are welcome.
Keep quiet!
Everything matters.
Get real!
Open up.
Be attentive.
Everybody lies.
Stand up!
Return fire.
Stop meddling.
We laughed.
Be yourself.
Think again.
Open fire!
Tom reads to his daughter.
Hey, relax.
I ran as fast as I could.
Stop crying.
Keep fighting.
Hold Tom tight.
I am studying.
Mama cried.
Tom approved.
Come inside.
How does this thing work?
That's your opinion.
Welcome back.
I thought Tom would ask Mary a few questions.
Really?
Tom agrees.
They smiled.
Tell me.
Tom failed.
Call security!
I forgot.
How awful!
Who knows?
Say nothing.
Nobody died.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Feel this.
Examine them.
What's your number?
Choose one.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Keep quiet.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch up with my friend.
Let me do my work in peace.
It was vague.
I promise.
I stayed home for a week.
Tom volunteered.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
Stop it.
Stay alert.
Eat slowly.
I don't have anything to give to you.
I'm not going into details.
Ignore that.
Straighten up.
Tom forgot.
Look again.
Tom doesn't wear a wedding ring.
Tom escaped.
Why are we running?
Move over.
Continue digging.
Stop that!
Tom said he needed a dozen eggs.
Have you been listening to me?
Forget Tom.
Drive carefully.
Tom closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
Wait here.
Defend yourselves.
I need to see Tom now.
Be sensible.
Keep singing.
You'd better go home as soon as possible.
Does this sound stupid?
Stop laughing.
Release him.
Get out.
Step inside.
Be respectful.
Tom and I'll go together.
The decision has been made.
I have two brothers and three sisters.
Your sweater's on backwards.
Think again.
It is already eleven.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
After you.
I know.
I fainted.
Tom is with his mother.
Tom agreed.
One day, you will understand.
Stand still!
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
Be prepared.
Champagne, please.
Don't wait for us.
Take cover!
Ladies first.
It happens.
I am glad that you have succeeded.
This will be easy.
Defend yourself.
Drive faster.
Stop talking.
You tried.
Tom could hear his name being called.
Call us.
She's afraid of the dark.
Keep back.
I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me.
Everyone dreams.
Tell everybody.
Say hello.
I never saw you.
I thought Mary still loved me.
She is busy with the care of her children.
Please sit.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
Watch carefully.
Loosen it.
What do you suggest I do?
Start singing.
The time women spend doing housework is now a lot less than it used to be.
Memorize this.
Tell Tom.
Ask anyone.
You tried.
This is a horse.
Time flies.
Tom can go hear Mary sing at that club whenever he wants to.
Women change the world.
Look closely.
Wonderful!
Be sensible.
Watch me.
Tell me.
He's three years younger than my older brother.
My knife is sharp.
Tom burped.
Do you have a more detailed map?
Sit still.
Leave everything.
Keep moving.
Take Tom.
Come in for a minute.
Do you want to see what I just made?
Call us.
She didn't want him to play poker.
I need to end this now.
Listen carefully.
Tom winked.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Keep digging.
There are birds singing in the cage, aren't there?
I don't care how much it costs. I'm going to buy it anyway.
Call us.
I've been thinking about it, too.
Have I missed something?
Tell Tom.
Tom really respects you.
I doubt that's what really happened.
Don't go out after dark.
Stay away.
Say nothing.
Nice shot!
Take mine.
He ran.
Tell Tom.
Won't somebody please help me?
Stop them.
Marry me.
That's really impressive.
Look back!
Tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it.
Dogs bark.
Tom thought he was being cute.
Read this.
Back off.
I'm the one who let Tom get away.
Please continue.
Memorize this.
He believed in the truth.
Start running.
Stop arguing.
Wash up.
It's a surprise.
Keep going.
Tom liked Australia.
Tom gets a lot of help from his friends.
Watch me.
Tom wants a new car.
Pace yourself.
I believe that you will succeed.
Time flew.
Do you want to see what I just made?
Cool off!
Stop arguing.
I don't have time to talk with you anymore.
Lie still.
They started hours ago.
Who quit?
Keep them.
We understand.
Tom is a runaway.
I am not a teacher.
Pace yourself.
I'm Armenian.
Help me.
I tripped.
Stop them.
He runs.
We apologize.
Nobody listens.
Tom can play the guitar, I think.
Leave us.
Can you speak French?
I don't understand that at all.
Leave us.
Behave yourself.
I overslept.
Tom drove.
Catch him.
Cool down.
Anybody home?
Tom was reunited with his father.
Stop squabbling.
Don't forget about us!
Keep moving.
Don't skip over any details.
I need that tape.
Tom and Mary are the only ones still in the room.
Be nice.
When do you shop?
Keep still.
Tom escaped.
There are always options.
Look there.
Stop overreacting.
You were supposed to wait.
Be friendly.
Stop yelling.
Sit down!
Drive on.
I didn't need Tom.
I've got a few minutes left.
Taste this.
Turtles don't have teeth.
I have two cats.
Look away.
Everything changed.
Say something.
Precision in measurement is necessary.
Examine them.
Nobody lied.
Stay positive.
No problem.
Keep looking.
This drawing is less than great. He needs to do something with the line here at the back of the leg.
What part of Boston does Tom live in?
I understand.
Ask Alex.
Mary's the laziest of her schoolmates.
I have never been to England.
Tom danced.
I've got a few minutes left.
Read this.
Stop laughing.
What's wrong with me?
Identify yourself.
Nobody volunteered.
We succeeded.
I think that there is a man there.
Apparently, not much has changed.
Say goodbye.
Tom didn't have further details.
I sing.
Take this.
Quiet down.
Grab Tom.
Someone who looks a lot like Tom is standing near the gate.
Why is Tom doing this?
Stop grumbling.
Nobody asked.
I have to put my shoes on.
Forgive us.
Did you stay here all night?
Well done!
There is a tall man in the classroom.
Drop it!
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Keep them.
Grab him.
Get Tom.
Stop talking.
Pardon me?
Just tell me why you're really here.
The tree is green.
Please sing.
Even if he doesn't come, we'll have to begin.
I am ready.
Tom baked a cake for Mary.
Examine them.
One language is never enough.
Behave yourself.
I can't stop thinking about what happened.
Look here.
I doubt that's what really happened.
Well done!
Be quiet.
Keep cool.
She wants to drink some warm milk.
Are there dogs that eat raw fish?
Everybody applauded.
Tom cried.
Why are they so mean to us?
Hurry back.
Keep searching.
Stop trying.
Check, please.
Take command.
Identify yourself.
Tom really wanted to go to Boston with Mary.
Stop arguing.
How interesting!
I forgot.
How unfortunate!
Come home.
Taste this.
When did you tell me?
Release him.
Stop here.
Watch yourselves.
Tom called.
Are you going to go on holiday this year?
They won.
Contact Tom.
Can we rent a car?
Come outside.
Start now.
Mr. Wang usually has a nap in the meeting room.
Tom kneeled.
Please reconsider.
Are you trying to be funny?
Keep that.
This stinks.
Tom doesn't want to be seen talking to you.
Be seated.
That worked.
I still believe you cheated me.
Continue working.
Answer me.
Go ahead!
Are you trying to be funny?
You wouldn't be lying to me, would you?
Tom moved.
Come quick!
Keep notes.
Everyone laughed.
Keep it.
Tom flinched.
Settle down!
Anything new?
Why is Tom running?
I exaggerated.
Be merciful.
Give it to my dog. He'll eat anything.
Unbelievable!
Tom asked Mary for a job.
Stay quiet.
Do you have a more detailed map?
Be careful.
Keep cool.
Cool down.
You can't make it without me.
Keep quiet.
Did you think that I'd forgotten that?
Why me?
She seems happy to be here.
Tom wasn't happy to see Mary there.
Watch out!
Stay quiet.
Tom smiled.
How can you not know?
What do you suggest I do?
They cheered.
I hope you enjoyed the long weekend.
Please smile.
She cried.
Watch me.
Do you have a dictionary?
Keep looking.
Sit still.
We understand.
Tell everybody.
Drive safely.
I see.
Look closely.
Stop laughing.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Come tomorrow.
Come in.
Even if we end up being late, it doesn't bother us.
Try this.
Be punctual.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
We're going to have fun.
Tom drinks.
Grab this.
Watch yourselves.
