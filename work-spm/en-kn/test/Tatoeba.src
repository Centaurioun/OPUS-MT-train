The couple posed for the photograph.
Would you mind my moving your car?
They have announced their engagement.
I believe in you.
She was very bored during the lecture.
There are many new programs to watch this spring.
My father and my brother work in this factory.

I have enough money to buy a car.
I made sure that no one was watching.
I'm getting better every day.
The cause of the accident is unknown.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
The war is still going on.
It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
He arrived at the station at five.

He couldn't keep his temper any longer.
From a movie star he became a statesman.
He had an accident at work.
He goes abroad every year.
He bought his daughter a new dress.
They failed to fulfill the conditions.
They caught sight of the man among the crowd of people.
She got married in her teens.
She treats me as if I were a baby.
She has something in her hand.
She seems shy, but has a strong will in practice.
She brought up two children.
She tried to get whatever she wanted.
Mr. Sato collapsed from exhaustion.

His trip will keep him away from the office for a week.
Good morning!
He agrees with my opinion.
What time is it?
Do you want to leave it like that?
One can hardly change one's point of view.
Any time you want to borrow my car, all you have to do is ask.
Give my regards to your family.
That's why he lost his job.
Tom knew who the killer was.
I'll let you know if I find anything interesting.
Are you finished reading the paper?
Brazil declared war on Argentina in 1825.
Where can we find the truth?
Tell us what you know about Tom.
Go to the wine cellar and get a couple of bottles of wine.
Tom told Mary to go home.
Tom won't be killing anybody else.
We're working on it.
It looks like we got lucky.
Some animals are afraid of fire.
You can't be in two places at once.
Let's get it right this time.
Let's greet our guests.
I'd like to see the agreement.
I just want to say that I was wrong.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Tom doesn't eat much meat.
How did it go last night?
The only time you talk to me is when you need some money.
Give me half.
What team do you play for?
In my opinion, eastern music is too noisy.
Mary is gorgeous.
Tom liked you.
Tom woke up.
They're useless now.
Just go inside.
Don't let Tom do it.
I can recommend a good lawyer.
I can tell this is difficult for you.
I don't know what came over me.
I had to get some money.
I've always believed that.
I suggest we don't even try.
I just got back.
My goal is to learn your language.
I only wish to help you.
I really owe you an apology.
I should've gotten up earlier this morning.
I think that went well.
You would've gotten away with it if Tom hadn't told on you.
These are Tom's glasses, not mine.
I wondered the same thing myself.
I'm sorry I missed your concert.
You are in love with him.
Tom is ready for you now.
Tom had almost forgotten.
See you at 2:30.
Last night, I read a book.
I don't see the small car.
Can we go inside?
That's all Tom needed.
I come inside to drink coffee.
The boy who came yesterday was my younger brother.
I didn't know that Tom spoke French.
It's my fault that you were fired.
Tom stared sadly out the window.
It very likely is going to be dangerous.
I forgot Tom was the one who taught you how to play the guitar.
Can you suggest another solution?
A great deal has happened since that time.
Tom promised to help me, but he didn't.
You have to tell Tom.
You need to stay awake.
Tom stayed with me.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell you everything.
You have to tell me exactly what I need to do.
There's nothing in the bucket.
Do you think it means something?
We'll think of another way.
I gave Tom a huge hug.
You let me down, Tom.
You shouldn't be here now.
You don't think I can do this, do you?
Let's hope we never have to do that.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Did Tom ever hurt you?
We should call off the search.
Tom is very careless.
Tom left three hours ago.
When does Tom usually go to the gym?
Does Tom have a crush on Mary?
That is your beauty.
I don't know how I can ever thank you.
I must be getting home.
Stupidity is no excuse.
Open your book on page nine.
I no longer feel that way about you.
Why are you thanking me?
I saw the girl.
What could possibly have gone wrong?
Isn't that what we should be doing?
I thought the food was too greasy.
That's not really a solution.
This is a horrible tragedy.
Do you know what Tom's last name is?
We needed it.
Her voice is better.
It cost twice as much as we expected.
Tom is a real competitor.
Do you know what Tom's surname is?
To be honest, I really don't know.
A few firefighters suffered minor injuries.
How did you get that scar?
I loved going to the beach.
