I miss you.
I love you.
What is your name?
Welcome.
I don't know.
Where are you from?
How are you?
How much is this?
Hold on.
Why didn't you help Tom?
Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Thy kingdom come, on earth as in heaven. Gives us our daily bread. Forgive us of our sin, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours. Now and forever. Amen.
Let's go there.
Try to do it like that.
Where is the other one?
You are very handsome today.
You are very pretty today.
Do you remember your promise?
Hope you can understand.
"In my vision, I heard an eagle, calling aloud as it flew high overhead, 'Disaster, disaster, disaster, on all the people on earth at the sound of the other three trumpets which the three angels have yet to blow!'"
I feel like that I have seen you before.
I will always loving you.
Who is being naughty?
Let's all drink!

Dom's father is cutting the chicken in the kitchen.

That fried fish was eaten by me.
