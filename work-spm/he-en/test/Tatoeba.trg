She can't ride a bicycle yet.
I drew a picture of a spaceship.
I don't want to tell them why I'm late.
We're confident Tom will do that.
Boy that was close.
You hate them, don't you?
The people at large are hoping for great changes in the light of the present situation.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.
She is pretty bad at tennis.
I know you worked very hard on it, but still I'm not satisfied with your report.
Keep smiling.
I'm going to show you something.
I don't have much appetite lately.
Do you have a gym membership?
His aim in life was to become a great doctor.
I like chocolate.
Tom is still not entirely satisfied.
He has a photographic memory.
A pilot guides the ship toward the port.
That's terrific.
She stopped breathing.
I need to hide these Christmas presents somewhere that Tom can't find them.
I can jump.
Write down your name here.
He doesn't just speak French, he speaks Spanish as well.
Read your statement before you sign it.
My uncle gave him a present.
They're all here.
Tom rescheduled.
Tom is always here.
I've always wanted to live in Boston.
We should sit back down.
I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason for this.
A friend of mine asked me to send him a postcard.
Yeah, show us your t... ranslations...
Why didn't you help him escape?
I bought a camera.
Today, many problems were encountered.
I don't think Tom is busy.
It happened two years ago.
I don't think this is going to work out.
The article was not received favorably.
Go through the market.
I don't think that's what we should be doing.
She's not confident about the future.
Tom and Mary aren't the only two who don't understand.
You're a lot like her.
It was a mistake on their part.
We must think over the issues carefully.
Please cancel my order and refund the money.
We've humiliated her.
The book is full of far-flung theories without any basis in scientific fact.
It's better not to take candy from strangers.
Tom scolded Mary.
Which do you like best - fish or meat?
Which search engine do you use?
What's the minimum salary in Sweden?
The cafeteria's primary problem is its quality.
Tom hated Boston.
Oh, no! I almost forgot!
My grandfather on my father's side is celebrating his 88th birthday tomorrow.
We got a hostile reception from the villagers.
My brother's six years younger than I am.
We were comfortable.
Tom was crossing the street when he got hit by a truck.
She doesn't care how she dresses.
Anything's better than nothing.
You'll end up getting an electric shock if you don't insulate that wire.
Their plane crash-landed in a dense jungle.
I'm first.
He slept an hour.
The dog seems sick.
Don't they think about the poor children who are dying of hunger?
What did Tom do?
He said that he gets up at 6 o'clock every day.
The house burned to the ground before the fire truck arrived.
I just wanted to talk to you.
I think that watching TV is a waste of time.
Iron is a useful metal.
I am not a philologist.
Mary is vivacious.
Anyone who can only think of one way to spell a word obviously lacks imagination.
Tom finished eating breakfast before Mary woke up.
I can't believe I did this.
I can't buy it because I don't have any money.
He refused our offer to arrange a press conference.
The forest contains many different plants.
I use my VISA card.
Tom grew up in the Midwest.
Keep climbing.
Tom anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
He made a bunch of money.
What happens when we die?
The odor in that room was vile.
She was caught red handed.
Please move quickly.
I live in Malta.
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
They're smiling.
Now I remember.
What is the language spoken in Brazil?
Tom is the one who drew this picture.
Tell me.
He nodded to show that he approved of my plan.
That's curious.
I have been to Kyoto twice.
It takes some time to fall in love.
What kind of fish is that?
Why are you talking about money?
Tom finished doing his homework an hour ago.
You keep out of this.
Tom has never asked a favor of anybody.
I like your car.
I thought that Tom would be able to help you.
Tom's important.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
I met her by accident.
He broke the law.
Tom is the best student in your class, isn't he?
It's no use arguing with Tom.
Is this your book?
Are you positive it was Tom?
Tom is available.
Provide starving people with food.
Don't be disgusting.
It's next to that building.
They are rich Englishwomen on a trip to Italy.
Will you sell your house to him?
She has a book.
We decided to put off the meeting until next Sunday.
You can believe what you want to about me, but that doesn't mean it's true.
You can ask Tom for help.
Tom dropped everything he was doing to help Mary.
I can't believe you did this.
Why are men so stupid?
I never bet on horse races.
She is resting now.
I'm pretty good at first aid.
These children are born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.
It doesn't matter.
The pleasure is all mine.
Tom knew nothing.
That bridge is anything but safe.
We were terrified.
Let's put this in the safe.
Some children play video games all the time.
That's better than nothing.
Did we run over something?
I'm just glad Tom is back.
I have nightmares.
I am five feet, two inches tall.
Does your sister study there?
My mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
I am not concerned with this.
Prices have soared.
I'd like to study with you, but I can't.
I'll find it.
Is that coffee?
Why did you buy a flower?
He knows quite well what it is like to be poor.
But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in the United States for 221 years; block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.
His personal servants hated him.
The author wrote furiously in a mad dash to get his story down on paper.
Shut the door tight.
The old men slept on the puncheon floor of the cabin, while the rest bivouacked out in front.
She is as intelligent as he.
He reads the newspaper every morning.
Mary's jealous.
Let's start!
Would you like a cup of milk?
