What is love?
He looks like his mother.
I get it.
That's too long.
Are you looking for this?
This makes me happy.
What do you want from us?
Carry her to the operating room.
I want to cook for you.
I'm studying French at home.
I get what you're saying.
Where do you want to live?
I will give it to you.
Whose coat is this?
They're coming home.
I have to stop.
They're very, very good.
They aren't coming today.
Am I in love?
I think I've got it.
Is your mother here?
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
I'm sorry I said that.
You have to stop drinking.
Let's buy this one.
I'm a new student.
He is similar to his father.
I thought you'd gone home.
I have money for you.
This is my cat.
Don't look at me!
Get out of my bed.
We study French.
We're brother and sister.
He's a good person.
I ran to my mother.
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
I don't get it.
Do you have the money?
Don't look at me.
It's my brother's.
Don't make me say it.
She loves him.
Why aren't you with me?
I go to school here, too.
He does not like us.
That makes us happy.
Are they Japanese?
What does it look like?
I love that book.
Do you know what he said?
Please call me up between seven and eight.
Nobody listens to me.
It's a good plan.
He isn't a child.
Where do you wanna live?
I am very sorry.
I'm sorry that I said that.
We've said our goodbyes.
Why don't you go home?
We're alone.
What do you do here?
She isn't paid monthly, but daily.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
I loved that car.
It isn't the same without you.
I'm coming to get you.
My stomach hurts.
I have to stop.
I must go now.
They're children.
She's a good person.
I know how to get there.
You can spend the night at our place.
I'll go on Sunday.
Don't forget to send the letter.
See you later!
Champagne, please.
My sister resembles my mother.
Come on, Tom. Don't be shy.
We understand.
They aren't happy.
Are you happy?
Where's your father?
We know you.
You're a good mother.
Where's Tom?
Go ahead.
Don't change sentences that are correct. You can, instead, submit natural-sounding alternative translations.
We're here because of you.
The money is gone.
I don't want to know about this.
I think so, too.
We're brothers.
I gave the boy a book.
I'm not hungry.
How much is it?
I'll be watching you.
We don't understand French.
I understand.
Do you know whose car this is?
Where're the shoes?
"Whose glasses are these?" "They are my father's."
I thought you went home.
He is happy.
He is a good student.
This is a great book.
Thank you very much!
I don't know what I want.
Don't forget us!
You are children.
Come on up here.
I know what love is.
You can choose whichever color you like.
I knew it.
I cut class.
Do you like studying?
The window is closed.
I know what to study.
That girl is good-looking.
Turtles don't have teeth.
I'm on my break.
This is how to cook rice.
Who is reading?
How many cups of coffee did you drink today?
Do you remember?
I know the girl.
He gave it to me.
Thanks a lot!
I'm sorry I said that.
But more often than not, we came back empty-handed.
I've given up on you.
They don't know about it.
I want one, too.
Where is the car?
I've said I'm sorry.
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
I know what to do.
You're a good person.
They are happy.
Are you looking for us?
Why are we doing this?
When do you go?
Ask him his name.
Take whatever you want.
He looks like his father.
You aren't coming, are you?
I will make you happy.
You don't want to know it!
I'll come back.
I'm sure I've seen him before somewhere.
I'm taking a break.
He does not speak English.
You're Germans, aren't you?
Don't make me do this.
We have no money.
I'll come by 10.
We are students.
Whose office is this?
I'll peel an orange for you.
No one knew what to do.
Where are you going?
Take one of these.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
Love is blind.
What time do you go home?
It's not about money.
I think he'll come.
You may not like it.
Do you know what love is?
You've got a fever.
Don't come again.
You are one of us.
I'm not about to stop.
This is our car.
How do you come to school?
I came here to study.
They don't want us to know.
I am new here.
I like what I see.
Why me?
I only know him by name.
Don't do it again.
What a thought!
Have you read this book?
My house is near the church.
I don't know her name.
Some of the workers have no experience.
I want to see you.
What's the purpose of your trip?
I couldn't control my tears.
We are happy to see you.
Are you coming or not?
My daughter is to get married in June.
Thank you!
I'll go see it.
It's Saturday.
I still remember the first time.
We go to the movies together once in a while.
Why don't you give up?
No one listens to me.
You are not my brother.
She didn't read the book.
Take a good look at this.
When do you get up?
I saw you.
I know what they're like.
Run for it!
I know what to look out for.
Get it out of here.
I love watching you cook.
I am glad you are here.
Where's the cook?
I'm not a rich man.
No rich people live here.
I know what you're thinking.
Let me go and buy some bread.
Where's your family?
I know how to do it.
No, thanks.
I need time to think.
No one knows her name.
What do you know about what happened?
I need a hug.
We love you.
What is he aiming at?
What do you take me for?
Listen to me.
I think I sat on it.
Does that satisfy you?
You have to go home.
I get what I want.
I am a cook.
What are your wishes?
She lives with him.
What's her name again?
Is she coming, too?
OK, I'll order it.
He understands French.
We came to see you.
We got separated.
That girl looks boyish.
Our trip is dependent on the weather.
Thank you for listening.
Do you like it?
My car is broken.
She is not there.
Whose house is this?
You know me.
I don't know those people.
I've come to take you home.
Is that your mother?
He is not a child.
If I don't eat, I will die.
You know him.
I'm writing about us.
You do not know me.
Thank you very much.
She likes him.
I'm in love with her.
Have a good look at this picture.
We'll see you there.
Don't forget to ask follow-up questions.
I sleep naked.
Take off your shoes.
It would have been better if you had not gone there.
Does that make you happy?
I knew you'd like it.
Have a drink with me.
We're out of money.
He wiped the sweat off his face.
I would do it again.
Don't be upset.
I don't have a home.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
Please read the text below.
I cut my finger with a knife.
I don't want to cook.
I love her.
Who do you think I am?
I'm very sorry.
Give it to him.
We love our parks.
I'm a university student.
I came looking for you.
Nobody knew what to do.
Where is Tom?
She is responsible for it.
I don't have a sister.
You understand me.
What are you looking at?
I have a big brother.
I've had a busy morning.
How much is it?
This boy is his brother.
You are children.
I saw my sister there.
These flowers you see are roses.
Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
Languages have hard words.
Whose phone is this?
Give it to her.
How do you know my name?
I think I understood.
If you need help, feel free to call me.
I'll come and get you.
Don't forget to send the letter.
Is your mother at home?
My house is near the church.
I'm not giving this up.
Stop reading.
I know what I'm doing.
Tell them what happened.
I want to talk to you.
I'm coming to get you.
Are you looking for this?
She picked out the most expensive dress.
It's not the same without you.
We know why you came here.
We'll all go together.
Get out of my room!
The car broke down.
Why do you think that?
Do whatever's required.
Is that why you came here?
Whose is this phone?
From tomorrow on we can go to work together.
Why do you love me?
Do you know what to do?
What a day!
The horse is jumping.
You must quit drinking.
I'm happy.
We should eat lunch together sometime.
I know what I would do.
When do you study?
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
It'll be hot.
Why don't we go somewhere together?
I don't care where you're eating dinner.
Why do you think so?
Come in.
You're not coming, are you?
I don't know where he lives.
My father isn't at home.
I know how to do this.
I felt ill.
She is a good student.
Do you want to drink anything?
Tell me about your plan.
I kissed her on the cheek.
I saw it coming.
Do you think I'm happy?
Where is your family?
There is no other choice.
What happened to you last night?
Goodbye!
I want you to read it.
Don't do it again.
I've got to fix my hair.
He's a Frenchman.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Why am I here?
I always hand wash my bras.
Don't do it again.
If you don't understand, ask.
If he had had time, he would have gone.
You don't give orders here.
Why do you have this?
I like your car.
Why don't you go home?
Where do you study?
What?
We should strike a balance between our expenditure and income.
Here's the bill.
We want complete sentences.
Take what you want.
You're not my brother.
Where is your mother?
The sun rises in the east.
Does she know that you like her?
I'm not proud of it.
You'll like him.
I'll ask him.
I know you.
Do you know something about this?
He looks like your brother.
How's the family?
Why do I have to do it?
Do you know what this is?
Don't look at me like that.
Here he comes.
Why do you think so?
Where's your father?
I'm one of your students.
I want you to go home.
I don't have a brother.
I have homework.
No rich people live here.
Why not come with me?
I've given up on you.
I know that you like me.
You don't have to come.
How are you today?
It isn't good.
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
What do you look like?
What's your take on this?
I understand it.
I want to see it.
We broke up.
Why do I have to go?
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
I've lost my glasses.
Where is Mary?
I know what's up.
Dogs often bury bones.
Thanks a lot!
They are not coming today.
Get out of the car.
I don't understand French.
I said get out!
Where is her family?
I hope you're doing well.
Nobody understands me.
I have a question.
Don't ask me again.
I've come to say goodbye.
My trousers are wet.
This knife is dull.
What shall I put on: trousers or a skirt?
Are you going or not?
We play on Sunday.
I don't know what to think.
I don't know your name.
Where are you taking us?
I'm not giving up.
I'm thinking about you.
I'm glad you are here.
The skirt is too wide for me.
This is too long.
We've arrived.
I came to say goodbye.
The hand has five fingers: the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, the ring finger, and the pinky.
I am hungry.
We're in the same class.
There was a church here once.
I knew you'd be happy.
Close the window.
Can you open the window?
Classes are over.
We should eat lunch together sometime.
It's not broken.
Investigate the cause of it.
You don't have to thank me.
Do I have to open the window?
What do you think this is?
Did you see their faces?
It's not a thing one can well boast of.
All of the apples that fall are eaten by the pigs.
I saw that, too.
No one knows where we are.
I have no home to live in.
I'm only here because of you.
Go to bed!
The skirt didn't fit so I had to alter it.
Get on with it.
I don't like studying.
Are they looking at us?
Take a book and read it.
I don't know about things like that.
Don't look at me that way.
Whose phone number is this?
It's not what you think.
I understand what you're saying.
There's a page missing.
She's not a child.
I will make you happy.
Whose fault is that?
Watch how I do it.
I knew you'd be happy.
It's very hot, isn't it?
They don't make you happy.
I do not think that he will come.
I know things about you.
Take the money.
I know the girl.
Is it too big?
Turtles don't have teeth.
Let me see.
Do you know what you're asking?
They want us to do it.
I want you to go home.
We're going west.
No one here has a car.
May I see that again?
Come to visit me.
We are brother and sister.
What do they do here?
He does not look happy.
I'm not a student.
She is responsible for it.
I want to learn French.
It's no use.
This is my new car.
It's ours.
Does he know that you love him?
What are you looking for?
Are you going home?
Why aren't you at school?
I'll make you happy.
Excuse me.
Are you students?
I thought that you knew.
A student wants to see you.
Don't open the window.
I love coming here.
I like studying French.
You look very happy.
Where do you want to go?
She spent all afternoon cooking.
I saw him again.
I know that girl.
Nobody knows what to do.
Do you want to see it?
Do you know what they said?
I don't have a home.
Take your shoes off.
Whose handbag is this?
What do you want to know?
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
Is this a new car?
Don't you want to know what happened?
"Whose glasses are these?" "They are my father's."
I ran out of money.
Does he live here?
I'm a baker.
He ran out of money.
I've lost my keys.
Are you new?
Where do you live?
She was brought up by her grandmother.
Give up!
I don't want to see you.
Don't send me away.
They're not coming today.
I think I got it.
What happened to your car?
In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?
You can choose whichever color you like.
I don't see how.
We're finally alone.
She doesn't know me.
How is your father?
Where do you know each other from?
That bed is very comfortable.
I have a headache.
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there.
Look out of the window.
Do you have rice?
My family is small.
She picked the most expensive dress.
No worries.
Yesterday was Friday.
Where do you park?
He cut a twig from the tree with his knife.
I'd like to rent a car.
I know you have it.
Is there something you want to get off your chest? Come on, you can tell me.
I'm the youngest child.
What does the bill come to?
Do you like it?
We are in the same class.
Take me home.
I am not hungry.
I know that.
I'm the youngest in the family.
I like where I live.
This is ours.
You're not coming, are you?
It's not the same.
God bless you!
Why don't you come with me?
No one's here.
My car has broken down.
When are you coming home?
I will try it.
You're a good student.
Me too.
Why don't you enter?
I'm not proud of it.
Make a good translation of the sentence that you are translating. Don't let translations into other languages influence you.
I'll do what you ask.
We understand.
This doesn't look like yours.
We're happy to see you.
Do you know what it says?
He's now studying.
I don't know how.
Why are you not doing it?
What are you reading?
What school do you go to?
Whose tea is this?
Why do you ask?
Get down!
May I come again?
The bus stop is five minutes' walk from here.
She used to be a teacher.
I don't want to give up.
Me, too.
Shall we begin now?
I have to learn French.
What're you reading?
I know why you want it.
Maybe this weekend we could go to the beach together.
Is this love?
Where is your brother?
Don't forget to post the letter.
I'm not a good person.
We are home.
Be kind to those who hate you.
I'm in love with her.
Where am I?
I don't have a brother.
It isn't my car.
Only a few drops of rain have fallen.
Can you remember this game?
I'm sorry for shouting at you.
Welcome to our home.
Don't give up on me.
He shook his head.
Stop the car.
You know that I have to go.
I'm in trouble because of you.
It's not what you think.
What's new with you?
I'm not going to stop.
Do you have a brother?
I don't like those people.
May I come again?
That'll make me happy.
I don't understand it.
Do you understand French?
He walked slowly so the child could follow.
You are my friend.
I don't see you.
Are you home?
Don't say that word again.
I know your mother.
Bananas are yellow.
Where are we?
Don't give up!
I'll give you a book.
I do not have a sister.
I like to study French.
It's too hot.
It is too hot.
I live here.
Do you want to know why?
You're not good at this.
I saw him running.
Why am I doing this?
I love watching you cook.
How is the family doing?
What do you think?
What're you looking for?
I know what's happening.
Is he American?
You'll like her.
How are things at home?
I'm not going to look.
I'm not a very good carpenter.
I know you said that.
Read!
It looks good on you.
Where do you know that from?
Why aren't you in school?
The explorers discovered a skeleton in the cave.
Nobody knows this.
You know that I like you.
You have to come with me.
This is good, isn't it?
Thanks for coming.
We don't have a car.
Do you have a brother?
I'm very good at it.
Do you like it?
I don't look like that.
Please read the text below.
I'll take this one.
I'm not hungry.
I'm in trouble because of you.
My house is near the church.
You'll want to see this.
Everything has its limit.
I respect you.
Do you want to stop?
He is French.
Are they Japanese?
He goes to work on foot every day except on rainy days.
They say that he's very rich.
I don't cook.
Do you know where they are?
Do you want to know how?
I love him.
We're brothers.
Dad isn't home.
Does Tom know why?
That bed is very comfortable.
I was wondering if you'd let me stay with you for a few days.
See you on Monday.
I have to learn.
How much does it cost?
This car is like new.
Not only does she speak English, but also German.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
I want to go home.
Read it once more.
I'll be in my car.
I know where they're going.
I have done it.
I'm in the car.
Step aside.
This is how we cook rice.
I need time to think.
Pus has formed in the wound.
Do your homework.
That made me think of you.
You are a good mother.
That girl looks like a boy.
How long will you stay?
I don't see him.
It's not my car.
Do you know what to do?
Do you have a car?
There was a church here once.
Why don't you want to go?
It looks good.
Get out of my room!
Please give me a hug.
Take me with you.
My father is home.
I've lost my pencil.
I just stubbed my toe.
No one knows his name.
Whose plan was that?
That's what I think, too.
How are things?
This made me think of you.
Does she live here?
May I see that again?
The exact same thing happened to my friend a week later!
I don't know how long.
Where's my car?
I don't know that word.
I love this car.
How is the family?
Do you like to study?
My father isn't home.
Are you at home?
Don't do it again.
Here's your order.
I'm washing the windows.
I have to take a break.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
He looks like your brother.
Are you looking for this?
She has hundreds of books.
We're not alone.
I know what I'll do.
We'll go together.
Don't you understand that?
Thank you for stopping by.
It made me think.
I know what they said.
Close the window.
Why are you not with me?
I study French at home.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
I don't know his name.
Take a good look at this.
It's not a thing one can well boast of.
This is a very good book.
Nobody knows.
Do you know this?
I still don't know yet.
You ran a red light.
I wanna go home.
Do you live here?
That's what I'm looking for.
Do you want to take that?
You ran a red light.
I am not proud of this.
They'll know what to do.
Take a number.
Give it to her.
I do want to see you.
We could go together.
This word comes from Greek.
I come from Brazil.
I'm happy you're happy.
He's similar to his father.
I am not a student.
I'm not happy with this.
This flag is very beautiful.
Do you love him?
I'm sorry that I dragged you into this.
What shall I put on: pants or a skirt?
Don't ask me what that is.
Why don't we take a look?
Don't stop him.
I cut my finger with a knife.
Do you know where they are?
I like short hair.
Look at him.
How do you go to school?
I have lost my keys.
I believe in you.
OK, I'll order it.
I know how to do it.
Do you know where she is?
This word comes from Greek.
They don't want to use it.
Say that again.
How much does it cost?
He's a big boy.
I sell clothing online.
I'm not in love with you.
I know his family.
I'm hungry.
I don't want your money.
Whose idea was it?
I don't know how.
There was no one there besides me.
Don't you know what it is?
I'm not good with names.
He's always losing his mobile.
Store in a cool and dry place.
I'm not an idiot.
I have a car.
Nobody listens.
I want you to read this book.
Your forehead is quite hot. I think you have a fever.
I'm new here.
I'm very sorry.
Those are my sister's books.
Do you know where I live?
I knew you'd be here.
Now that we're alone, let's have fun.
I'm not in love with you.
Does Tom know why?
January is the first month of the year.
I'm not a student.
We're going to make it.
I watched it on YouTube.
Is it white?
We want you to take it.
I couldn't help crying.
I knew you'd go there.
I know that you're listening.
You aren't coming, are you?
It is Saturday.
It's too long.
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are the twelve months of the year.
We do not know him.
What makes people do that?
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
Whose book is this on the desk?
I like you, too.
I think I still have time for another cup of coffee.
How annoying!
I don't understand this word.
This book is excellent.
Nobody asked you.
Do you know his name?
I love you.
I like you.
The wedding will take place on Saturday.
From six until eight in the evening is happy hour.
This'll be great.
We know that.
She has lost her car key.
Is it too big?
It doesn't look good.
I saw my sister there.
Look there.
Hi!
I'm not a pupil.
You can sing a song.
I'm doing it for you.
Do you want to be rich?
He looks like my father.
They want us to do it.
I take it.
Why is it so hot?
Why don't you listen?
Let's open the window.
We came to see you.
I never forget a face.
May I take your order?
Listen to your mother!
You may go there.
Do the children go to school?
What are you good at?
That's enough.
Why so much hate?
I don't need it.
Where is the book?
Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
I know what you look like.
This flag is very pretty.
I'm going to take off.
Good night!
I'm not about to stop.
How long do you want it for?
Magdalena and Ania are good friends.
I'm in the kitchen.
We don't know it.
Does she know you?
You have to go home.
I don't understand you.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
I am not proud of this.
The skirt is too wide for me.
We're here because of you.
Don't come back.
I like math.
You're very good at this.
My voice is hoarse from a cold.
She is pregnant.
I don't care as long as you are happy.
I don't like to run.
How is your sister?
Where did everybody go?
Where do we go?
There she comes.
I like to read.
I know you're listening.
I don't know what to say...
You know her.
I want to go with you.
You may go there.
There is no water left in the bottle.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him well.
I'll take a look at it.
Why aren't you in school?
Mind your head.
I need three volunteers.
You aren't listening.
I never lie.
I want to study French.
I loved you.
Why aren't they coming?
We miss you, too.
Where are we?
I'm happy you're here.
The dress is made of silk.
Give me the book.
Is that better?
Don't look down.
They say he is very rich.
He is responsible for it.
I told my parents everything.
He accused the man of stealing.
That's how it is.
She understands him.
I want to see you again.
I think it's OK.
I made that dress by myself.
No problem.
Where's Mary?
No one is home.
I thought you'd understand.
Why don't you come in?
I know what I need to do.
Antique carpets are especially valuable.
Whose bed is that?
There she is!
I like living here.
I know her.
Why are they saying that?
Why are you at home?
My grandmother speaks slowly.
I've read this book.
Take this to your mother.
Why do you study French?
Is that what you think, too?
Where are you?
That street is very noisy.
I know what's going on.
I'm sorry that I said that.
It is not my day.
Good question.
I am a teacher.
I lost my keys.
Can I come in?
I slept all day yesterday, because it was Sunday.
I know what you are thinking.
I don't have books to read.
Why don't you try this jacket on? It looks nice with your trousers.
