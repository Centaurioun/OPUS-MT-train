It's a shame, my best friend is moving. He's going to live in another city.
I'm not happy with this.
Where's my mom?
You're my friend.
Is there a washing machine in the house?
Could you repeat that?
I'm sorry I said that.
She likes to read books.
I have an older brother.
Do I know Tom?
I'm not proud of this.
I know how to use this.
It belongs to my brother.
I know these people.
Do you know her?
I know how to do it.
We are brothers.
He has a car.
Today is Wednesday.
We're very happy.
Where is my watch?
She's lost her car key.
We're students.
Why are you asking?
I'll take you with me.
I bought a few eggs and a little milk.
We know what you're doing.
What's new?
You'll want to see this.
Thank you for stopping by.
Many trees fell down.
Stop staring at her breasts!
Can I use this?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good. And you?
My neighbor is a carpenter.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
I thought it would make you laugh.
I have to see you.
I don't think that he will come.
That's what I want to know.
Do you know where he lives?
You know I have to go.
Store in a cool and dry place.
You need a plan.
Come to visit me.
We have arrived.
You are not coming, are you?
How old is he?
It's perfect.
I don't know.
You must go home.
No one is listening.
I know what I will do.
Get it out of here.
Where do you come from?
You're not my brother.
I'm unlucky.
I have money.
You don't have to come.
He's happy.
I'm happy you're here.
Do you know those people?
Where are your things?
Take off your shoes.
I know how that goes.
I swear.
I thought that you went home.
I know your father.
I'm not rich.
I'll go get my car.
Whose beer is this?
I will try.
I'm going to bed.
No one saw a thing.
Is there somewhere we can talk?
Do you know what they want?
I want to take a break.
Are they coming, too?
Is it broken?
You take the money.
Don't ask.
That's why I love you.
Is this French?
Are you looking for me?
He doesn't speak English.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
Forget it.
I'm glad you are here.
I know where you live.
He is not there.
How about Friday?
This isn't French.
Don't ask for money.
We'll all go there together.
You live here, don't you?
Shall we go together?
It's not necessary to write a long letter.
I have no car.
Where's the car?
What do you do?
Is everything arranged for the trip?
I lost my glasses.
I know what they're doing.
There is a page missing.
That's a very good car.
It depends on you.
It's going to happen sooner or later.
You make me happy.
They know us.
What do you want to watch?
When do you get up?
No one's home.
What is this thing used for?
I didn't know you were going to be here today.
Where are the shoes?
It's going to happen sooner or later.
The museum is closed on Mondays.
What do you see?
Is she your sister?
Where's our car?
We broke up.
I don't want to be rich.
I knew you'd be happy.
I'll make you happy.
We have no money.
Close all the windows.
What do you see out there?
I'll give it to you.
Does that satisfy you?
If you don't understand, ask.
I thought that you'd gone home.
My brother is not at home.
I like maths.
I'm glad you're here.
Do you like it?
What have you given me?
I made that dress by myself.
My daughter will get married in June.
I ate eggs yesterday.
I don't know what to do.
You know we love you.
I'm happy with that.
This factory manufactures automobile parts.
Do good to those who hate you.
Where is he playing?
Why don't you get one?
Why is it upside down?
I thought you would understand.
I'm happy that you're happy.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
Why is the sky blue?
Don't forget to post the letter.
Don't listen to her.
You are my friend.
I know what to watch for.
I'm going to take off.
I am not a student.
The patient fainted at the sight of blood.
I'm not happy about it.
How is it going?
I gave birth to my first child last year.
I am a university student.
Where's your mother?
Why do you have this?
Can I open the curtain?
Don't you understand that?
I felt bad.
Whose fault is it?
Read this.
I'm not good at French.
Can you tell a sheep from a goat?
We know it.
My father is at home.
I don't think that he'll come.
Go away!
I'm taking you to school.
Tell me about your plan.
Take a break.
The price is going up.
Prices went up.
I speak three languages.
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
The weather was not only cold, it was also damp.
No one asked you.
I want you to know that.
I don't have a sister.
I'm taking a break.
We don't really have to talk about this right now, do we?
Do you want to drink something?
Don't give me that look.
I'm reading a book.
If I had known it, I would have gone there.
See you again.
My dream came true.
I'm not about to stop.
I'll try it.
I know what I'd do.
I'm in love with her.
Where's your car?
I know it.
You'll be very sorry.
After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath.
Shut up!
We're out of money.
I thought that you'd understand.
Whose phone is that?
I don't want to be here.
No, thank you.
No one knows what to do.
He is in love with her.
I'm not proud of this.
The windows are open.
Where is my money?
He looks like his mother.
Do you want this or not?
OK, I'll order it.
Whose wine is this?
Can you spare a minute?
My father's car is new.
I can't hear it.
I'd like to see her.
I say what I think.
We're going to be rich.
Say it in French.
I want you to see her.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
Could you say that again?
We grew up together.
He came in person.
Are you learning French?
Whose idea was this?
This car is my father's.
Where is your father?
I am a new student.
Are you going or not?
I don't have any sister.
What a day!
You are not coming, are you?
You know where I'll be.
What time do you get up?
Give me your watch.
I'm going to take this.
Do you think I don't care?
We understand each other.
My daughter will get married in June.
Why do I have to do that?
Why don't people like me?
These books are ours.
Hi.
I started working for this company last year.
I'm taking you with me.
I want to go, too.
I know him only by name.
It's not new.
I saw you.
In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?
I'm not coming with you.
Are you home?
Your o's look like a's.
This is how I did it.
It's not a date. We're just going to see a movie together.
I learn French at school.
I did it for you.
I saw him.
She is happy.
Why are they here?
Where do you go to school?
I really want to see you.
Why don't we go home?
I think it's fine.
I'm taking the day off.
That black one is mine.
I'm sorry that I dragged you into this.
Let me have a look at it.
I thought that was your job.
I don't feel comfortable here.
That word is of Greek origin.
I can't remember anyone's name.
Are you looking for us?
What do we have here?
Are you looking for this?
I want to read this book.
He likes to read books.
She did not read the book.
You know that I love you.
Why are you home?
Come and see this.
You have to get up.
I love my family.
Does goodness charm more than beauty?
You are one of us.
It doesn't take very long.
I know nothing about it.
Why aren't you there?
She isn't pregnant.
Do you know where he is?
Here is your book.
It's a quarter to three.
Tom is a carpenter.
Are you coming or not?
You know I like you.
It's not important.
That'll be great.
What do you think this is?
Watch where you're going.
Tell them what happened.
I wanna see you.
I'm not good with names.
I'm not a good person.
I don't drink.
There are no problems.
This is good, isn't it?
These windows look to the south.
There's no problem.
I saw your father.
Why don't they like me?
I'm happy with that.
You're a good cook.
You are a good student.
I still have some pain in my knee.
What's going on down there?
I have to know why.
Is everything arranged for the trip?
It's going to be great.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
I'm not good at this.
Nobody knows his name.
Where are they taking you?
That book is of no use.
I came to say hi.
The factory will begin to produce next year.
Why are you asking me?
Come here!
I like your car.
Have a drink with me.
My left arm is asleep.
I love what I'm doing.
You don't know my brother.
That's my car.
I want to know your name.
Do you see it?
You have no idea what happened, do you?
I'm not going to stop.
It's Monday.
She is in love with him.
I don't know what you want.
Where's your watch?
No one has said a word.
I don't know how to cook.
I am washing the windows.
No one is here.
I don't see how.
I'll go get it.
That's why I like you.
Do you know whose is this car here?
They saw me.
We know him.
My parents call me up every day.
It is Monday.
You are a good person.
Why are you asking this?
I know you know this.
Why do you study?
I'll make you happy.
I'm watching you.
The factory produces thousands of bottles every month.
I know where she is.
He works in a factory.
I'm not happy about it.
My dream has come true.
I will make you happy.
I know why you're here.
When will you come home?
Do you want to come in?
They say he's very rich.
That girl looks boyish.
Where's your brother?
These measures can prevent the disease from spreading.
You're not listening.
This book's new.
When do you want to go?
Sleep well, Timmy.
It's very good.
Whose fault is it?
We're wasting precious time.
I know where we are.
What's the purpose of your trip?
I don't have a car.
Here she is!
We don't want to know.
The bus stopped, but nobody got off.
Nothing happened.
He is responsible for it.
Where's my money?
I am Chinese.
They don't know about it.
What do you want to watch?
Here is the bill.
Listen!
What are you doing here?
I'm going to make it.
He did not read the book.
Why are we doing that?
I don't understand French.
He is in love with her.
If I had known, I would not have come.
Your pants are dirty.
Do you want me to come?
I have to study French.
She understands him.
They don't have any money.
Why don't you just tell us what's on your mind?
You're sick. You have to rest.
This intersection is dangerous.
I know what you are thinking.
I don't know where they are.
Is Tom there, too?
Here's $5.
No one knows their name.
She is in love with him.
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
It's too small.
I know what I need to do.
You are a good cook.
Here she comes.
I don't want to read it.
You don't know me.
It made me think.
I didn't know that you were going to be here today.
It's too small.
I have to know.
That makes me happy.
There he comes.
Mind your head.
Who is your teacher?
Let me buy you a new one.
I am listening to you.
Would you have time to help me with something?
I get off there, too.
I don't know how long.
We could go together.
Excuse me!
They're very, very good.
Is that your mom?
For how long will you stay?
We don't know him.
I cannot rinse the dishes. There is no water.
I don't have money.
A promise is a debt.
Do you know how that looks?
The boy is jumping.
Forget it!
Why don't you do it?
She's happy.
I'm resting.
Do you know what she said?
I'm a student.
Do you want to take that?
I don't need it.
I don't want to be rich.
It's very hot here.
My mother loves me.
These windows look to the south.
I hear what you're saying.
Don't drink that.
Do you want a car?
Don't you want to know why?
We know her.
I don't get you.
Are you home?
Our trip is dependent on the weather.
I don't want the money.
If you have gum in your mouth, spit it out.
Today is Sunday.
Why are you asking me?
Don't look down.
Take one of these.
This book is very good.
I love what I do.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
Do you have my money?
I spend a lot of time practicing the guitar.
Where's my watch?
Whose plan was that?
Get me out of here.
I know you like me.
I want you to see this.
I'm sorry for shouting at you.
I'll understand.
How long has she been sick?
I heard you got married.
Take your shoes off.
I'm looking for you.
Do you have my money?
I forgot to buy bread.
I'm not going to stop.
I am reading a book.
Are they American?
Where is his family?
Can you tell a sheep from a goat?
I'll take care of it.
Many thanks.
Don't come again.
Are there two windows in your room?
She is French.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
I'll be taking the car.
They say that he is very rich.
I get up at 7:00.
Get out.
Do you want it or not?
Do you want something to drink?
You'll love it.
I told my parents everything.
She doesn't live with him.
Do you understand it?
We're getting it.
Let me give you a hug.
I'm out of breath.
How long do you want it for?
He doesn't look happy.
Are you a new student?
I don't know anything about it.
Open the window.
The room's nice.
They have no money.
We grew up together.
The money is gone.
This is my father.
I'm happy with it.
You have my word on it.
It's not what you think.
Why are you going there?
Where do you know him from?
Thank you!
You have to go get it.
She looks like her mother.
I know that you have it.
Why aren't you with me?
No one understands me.
Are you a good dancer?
That is what I want to know.
What do you know?
I'm planning to read as many books as I can this year.
I know what I would do.
I'll try.
Come off it.
Do you have a brother?
He loves her.
I love math.
I have sisters.
Take this to your mother.
Look at this photo.
Shut the fuck up!
I'm a teacher.
It isn't good.
What's your favorite kind of book to read?
I have lost my pencil.
I'm thinking of you.
How's your sister?
Do you want to be rich?
I took the money.
I don't understand it.
There is no problem.
Give it to him.
I am glad you are here.
I know what you're thinking.
You have to go home.
I have to stop.
I study French at school.
Get down.
We are happy.
I had a busy morning.
I know that you're listening.
You're the woman I love.
You don't look that good.
Is it too small?
Why do they do it?
Watch where you're going.
Get out of the car.
I know those women.
The snake swallowed a frog.
She shaved her head.
I don't know him.
Where do you come from?
Your trousers are dirty.
How's your father?
Why don't we go home?
I thought you knew.
You may not like it.
I am not hungry.
I miss you very much.
You don't listen.
Why aren't you here?
I came here to study.
That's one of ours.
I have to think.
You don't want to know it!
This book is new.
He doesn't like us.
He goes to work on foot every day except on rainy days.
He doesn't know me.
Don't be shy.
You know I love you.
Who's your teacher?
I know you're listening.
You'll make it.
We are brothers.
Could I have the bill, please?
How old is he?
I'm a cook.
My name is John.
I want to live with you.
I like mathematics.
She looks like her mother.
I know him.
What is going on down there?
I'm listening to you.
Do you love her?
You can use this car.
Why do people say that?
Don't add sentences from copyrighted sources.
Why aren't you at school?
What don't I understand?
We want natural-sounding translations, not word-for-word direct translations.
What do you do?
It is the same book as the one I have.
I'm glad you're here.
This is how I made it.
You are not my brother.
You used to smoke, didn't you?
He doesn't love us.
There were a hundred people in the hall.
Isn't this great?
We ran down the hill.
I don't know where you live.
I know what I'm saying.
Listen to your mother.
I don't know that word.
Why don't you study French?
Stop looking at me.
I know that you said that.
I have sisters.
I have a fever.
I go to school here, too.
Don't look at it.
What kind of books do you like to read?
I'm not home on Sundays.
Stop saying that!
We're university students.
Whoever wants to marry her must first convince her father.
I don't want to get sick.
What do you want to see?
That girl looks like a boy.
Do they live with you?
I don't know where to go.
I know what I'd do.
He didn't keep his word.
I'll think about it.
Let me have a look.
I know what I have to do.
I'm sorry that I said that.
Where is my car?
This wall is cold.
Don't make me say it.
Is that why you came here?
Welcome to our home!
We're back.
