Tom took a sandwich out of the picnic basket and started eating it.
You really should quit smoking.
They went hand in hand.
You seem surprised.
This looks like it might be the weapon that was used to kill Tom.
You know that we don't have much time right now.

I beg to differ.
This isn't the first time that I've forgotten to do that.
What's wrong with you?
I'm ready if you are.
I'm looking for a lipstick to go with this nail polish.
Don't push.
We'll be listening to their new album together.
How are these events connected?
I only wanted to talk to Tom.
What do you think happened here?
I'll have some letters to write.
I feel very strong.
I have read some of these books.
I know you'd never do that intentionally.
I won't stay with you.
We were partly right.
We can't continue without Tom.
I'll do it.
I hurt myself today.
Who discovered America?
Put the car into the garage.
He's spreading false rumors.
You can sit down now.
I just clipped my nails.
Tom asked if he was invited.
Please iron the shirt.

Sometimes he talks a little weird.
Time seemed to stop.
Cherries are red.
"How much does an elephant eat each day?" "I think I read somewhere that an elephant can eat about 150 pounds of plants on a daily basis."

It's too cold.
I just love that kind of stuff.
How effective is it?
I can't think otherwise.
Tom isn't Mary's type.

We'll deal with that later.
I had to make a decision.
How was the reunion?

Down with the king!
Then what?
I had a hearty breakfast.
You hate Tom, right?
I need one more.
