A cat was on the table.
Which country are you from?
Tom dyed his hair dark brown.
I've been concerned about them.
He has made a promise to come again.
A cat came out from under the desk.
It doesn't really make much sense, does it?
I am your daughter.
I only want to help you.
I caught a cold.
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I know your son.
I won't tell anyone about him.
Tom won't be here for a long time.
You can't miss it.
Water is heavier than oil.
I locked the door.
You weren't that bad.
The parcel weighs more than one pound.
I hate waiting.
His story moved her to tears.
I don't need anything.
I got letters from a person I've never met.
Do you know why he couldn't come?
If the idiots would compete, you would be second because you are too idiot to be the first.
Even my parents don't like me.
He attempted to escape.
We need rules!
Is this your beer?
What's he doing there?
I love you!
Sami is staying with a friend.
I don't want to go home.

I'm used to it by now.
I've never seen anything quite like this.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
The sky is blue, the sea is also blue. The sky and the sea are blue.
That's life.

May I have a look at your ticket?
You're afraid of him.
Can I bring my friends?
He's my neighbour.
I would rather not go there alone.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
After lunch today, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
We've looked everywhere.
Let's forget about them.
They should have arrived home by now.
Are you sure she can do it?
All's well that ends well.
He left for a month.
Tom was disturbed at the direction of his thoughts.
This book is good but that one is even better.
Is your mum at home?
You're wrong. I'm not pessimistic, but sceptical.
We bought it.
Tom won't be able to keep up with you.
The television costs more than the sunglasses.
We can't afford any more mistakes.
Do you have any money left?
Do you speak French?
Mom is busy working.
Tom forgot all about me.
They live in the house opposite to ours.
They ate fish.
Mind your own business!
Welcome to Tatoeba!
You always have a choice.
Did you watch TV tonight?

The question is where to buy the book.
Why do you have three cars?
What would you do if you were in my place?

Do you have a smartphone?
Are you wearing gloves?
Our cat is in the kitchen.
Smoking affects our health.
Give it to me, please.
I'd like to see you, please.
This is the view from the balcony.
I have always identified hard work with success in life.
He will never believe me again.
You're not bad at this.
Time flies.
He lives in a small town near Osaka.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
I made Ann a doll.
Tom doesn't know what to say.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
Do you have a smartphone?
Don't you want to know why I didn't do that?
I'm glad you finally made it back.
This, however, is not possible.
I am your father.
Tom put his arms around me.
I work as a secretary on a farm.
I don't want to change.
Tom was captured.

I don't think anyone noticed what you did.
I'll see you when I get back.
We forgot all about them.
Sami can't tell Layla how to get money.
In the park birds are singing all around.
She's pleased with her new dress.
She likes wine.
My friend sent me a letter in which he asked me if I'm well.
Are you afraid to die?
I don't have much interest in cooking.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Try this sauce.
We don't need anyone else.
Help! I'm drowning!
What's your favorite leisure activity?
That's how I feel about them.
I won't be here next month.
Tom's hands were cold.
Suddenly I felt solid ground under my feet.
His silence surprised me.
I'll buy you a beer.
These trees were planted by them.
He left for a month.
Maybe I shouldn't be so suspicious.
There is always something to do.
I'm worried about the kids.
We carried out that plan.

Tom couldn't answer all of the questions.
Tom only spent three dollars for his lunch.
My brother lives in Tokyo.
Many thanks.
I forgot about him.
I won't tell anyone about her.
Tom didn't do it.
What do we do about them?
Tom will miss me.
We need to burn all this stuff.
You are drunk!
She has a round face.
Who are you working for?
Hello!
I stay in Osaka.
I'm saving up so that I can go to Australia.
My name is Tom. What's yours?
I am familiar with his music.
I never heard him sing.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
What should I do about them?
You're the girl of my dreams.
I wouldn't blame you.

Call the hospital.
I'll give it back.
I don't want to go back.
I go to bed about ten.
Tom never got better.
Nothing is holy.
Come in.
I don't want to hear about them.
He is my brother.
Wait a moment.
Could I talk to you alone for a second?
I'd be crazy to expect such a thing.
When was the last time you danced?
It always takes time to get used to a new place.
Sami fixed that last week.
I know everything about them.
This is a souvenir from Hokkaido.
The moon moves around the earth.
Where do you get those lamps?
Why don't you just tell us what's on your mind?

We're concerned about him.
Did you call?
I won't forget that.
Open your mouth!
I love summer.
We hope to organize a tennis club.
Tom didn't know what to say.
She's looking at us.
I don't want to be alone.
Did you telephone him?
I don't want to meet her.
What do we do about her?
I'll come back.
