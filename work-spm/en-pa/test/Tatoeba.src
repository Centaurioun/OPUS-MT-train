Let's try something.
I have to go to sleep.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
Muiriel is 20 now.
The password is "Muiriel."
I will be back soon.
I'm at a loss for words.
This is never going to end.
I just don't know what to say.
That was an evil bunny.
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Your view is too optimistic.
What would you do if you were in my place?
I fainted.
Get back, get back!
I try.
Nothing happened.
It's time to go to bed.
I had a hard time of it.
Terrific!
Wow!
If only there were no wars in the world.
When do you leave here?
I received a letter in English yesterday.
The villagers were offhand with us.
And the boy grew older.
In the Middle Ages, milk was still popular as a medicine.
I never thought they would accept me.
I'll tell him so when he comes.
His aunt looks young.
I wear a sad look.
Keep in touch!
Well, I'll only take toast and coffee.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
What time is it?
I was saying that I didn't think that it was weird at all.
That did me good.
Ah, that's much better.
How many Chinese friends do you have?
Tom was in no hurry to get married.
When did you find out?
Tom wants to tell you about Mary.
A trucker nearly froze to death on the road.
I gave him a grammar book.
Tom rescued Mary.
Please present your claim tags.
I had a lovely night.
I should've told Tom everything.
I have two cats.
Do you have a French dictionary?
Tom speaks with a Cockney accent.
I'm not that kind of guy.
You're more than welcome.
Tom should've protected Mary.
Two glasses of apple juice, please.
I don't get enough sleep.
We're not buying anything today.
Did Tom find what he was looking for?
What is all this rumpus about?
I would've said the same thing.
All German nouns are written with the first letter capitalized.
Get ready for a shock.
It's time to go up.
I would have said yes.
Why didn't you come to ask me earlier?
Tears of joy streamed down Mary's face as Tom said, "I do."
Denial is one of the strongest human defence mechanisms.
If you say exactly what's on your mind all the time, you're likely to upset a lot of people.
And if she is wrong?
What is a religious sect?
If I'd wanted to go, I would've said so.
If I want to go, I'll let you know.
I want to know as soon as anything happens.
If I'd wanted your opinion, I'd have asked for it.
Milk was sold in glass bottles.
If I ever turn into an alcoholic, I'll surely go on vacation to Antalya.
I approve his suggestion.
Tom works for a small company.
Will you still be here when I get back?
He watered the rose bush.
A lot's happened while you've been away.
The bird is in the sky.
Do you know what the Philippine currency is called?
