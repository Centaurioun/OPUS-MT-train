Me!
What were you doing when she came?
Thanks for everything.
Whatever!
I did not hear you.
They called you.
He demoted you.
That's impossible for me.
My ass!
Sit tight.
Tom had to pay a fine because he parked in the wrong place.
Buy!
Tom didn't tell anybody he wanted to do that.
I extended my holiday.
Watch the road.
Where would you like to go?
Tom is the most boring person I know.
Where are you?
Bearing can be unbearable.
Tom, behind you!
I've been to Boston numerous times.
Is this lake deep?
Tom wasn't very motivated to do that.
I'm not usually picky about food.
I didn't mean to stare.
Look behind you.
In my opinion, the meeting was a success.
Die!
Sami forced Layla to lie.
I need you.
What're you saying?
We should be getting back.
Why?
Tom is the strongest.
I'm sorry. I came late.
Since Mary is sick, I'm sure she won't do that.
You drink tea.
I extended my holiday.
Leave now.
There is very little water in your coffee.
Mary lives in her own world.
What were you doing when she came?
I want him gone by noon.
I just want him to go away.
Smile!
It took Tom several hours to assemble a bunk bed that the instructions said would take less than an hour to assemble.
Tom stepped on some broken glass.
Cows give milk.
Look behind you.
Thank you for boiling the water.
Children need loving.
Really?
Don't you want to stop Tom?
Tom was glad to hear Mary's voice.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
I want you to read this book.
This is a cat.
Pack your bags.
It has been ten years since my father passed away.
Yes.
Are they Japanese?
What're you saying?
I've got beer.
He plays beach volleyball.
I don't think they're going to hear us.
Stand up!
Where's the director?
Tom went without food for a whole week.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
I like funny guys.
Why do you think Tom and Mary are stupid?
I just hope Mary does what we asked her to do.
I'm OK for now.
I really thought Tom and Mary were hungry.
Tom and I became friends when we both lived in Boston.
He has tea every morning.
You can't escape from me.
What time is it now?
I was bothered by the baby's crying.
You may do what you wish.
It never occurred to me that Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Can I make a phone call?
What do you want?
Grab him.
Tom, behind you!
Come quick!
Who?
He is in need of money.
Quiet!
Impossible.
You'll cook for us tonight, won't you?
Tom lost his camera in Boston.
Tom is the strongest.
Who's hungry?
Who's hungry?
I'm sure you're very busy.
My name is Tom.
I was just making sure.
He arrived here just now.
I love God.
I saw Tom running down the street.
Do you know who Tom's mother is?
Mary doesn't like milk in her coffee.
The truth is I told a lie.
They seem to know all about us.
This book is easy for me to read.
A computer game was given to me by my father.
The other day I ran out of gas in the middle of a busy Interstate.
Earth laughs in flowers.
Ow!
Tom and Mary claim they've done that already.
What is the name of this river?
Mother Earth.
We'll fail.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
Sami was arrested.
Mary had to admit she was wrong.
The hospital where Tom was born is in Australia.
Stop tickling me!
Are you crazy?
Everybody's got something to hide.
Thank you with all my heart.
Tom seems sincere.
We've got something.
Do you know what this is all about?
I saw Tom give a flower Mary.
Cool off!
I think I'll be very busy, but after the test I will have more time.
This is very good.
We will clarify what is true and what is false.
The store will be closed tomorrow.
He leaves at eight.
If you want peace, prepare for war.
We want what's best for you.
Why do I need to learn French?
Stop tickling me!
I can't believe we're all still here.
Warning: the lifeforms in this universe are surrounded by 10% dandruff. Would you like to set up a new one?
Dead?
Mr So-and-So is dead. Why would I bother going to his funeral since, I am certain, he won't come to mine?
These are pens.
Jesus answered them.
Toronto's mayor was caught on tape smoking crack.
These animals are friendly.
Hush!
He is eight.
Brian lives over the hill.
Tom pulled out his key and opened the door.
Whose are these pens?
Tom is a couple of years older than me, I think.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
I bought a pen for your birthday present.
You can't escape from me.
He was right to keep silent.
What were you doing at that time?
Stand up!
I'll take the jacket.
It's refreshing.
Sami is a good dad.
Fuck!
What are those numbers?
We thought you might want to come with us.
One more time, please.
Precisely!
Halt!
Choose one.
I was so cold.
The moon is shining.
Kneel!
It won't fly!
Tennis is difficult. I never know which way the ball is going to fly.
I did everything to become your friend.
This is very good.
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
Mary said she doesn't want to ever do that again.
Pull yourself together!
These chairs are different.
How do you know Tom is there?
I'd like some plum jam.
You can't escape from me.
Do you have a steady boyfriend?
I am asking questions to my father.
Tom is the strongest.
Jupiter is so large that all of the other planets in the solar system could fit inside of it.
I've spent most of my life here.
Your room is twice the size of mine.
Next time, don't drop it.
I feel like I'm stealing your sentences.
I came because of something you wrote.
Stars are beautiful.
I'm not the only one who's hungry.
Understood?
Tom was kneeling.
How am I going to impress Tom?
I'll get him to carry this box upstairs.
I have to go to the toilet.
I want you, Tom.
Tom is just finishing setting up.
Do you like the movie?
She speaks as if she had really been in France.
I don't have time.
I'll see you at home.
Choose.
Did you buy me anything?
Stand aside.
When I woke up, I was in the car.
I told my parents everything.
These pants don't fit me.
That book is a new book.
Tom just saved my life.
Why are you all shocked?
He doesn't look like he's tired.
What're they doing?
Hungry?
He spoke to me when he saw me.
We've come home.
Be cool.
Yes, I have time tomorrow.
How did their glasses get swapped? Even they themselves didn't understand it!
He has a bruise on his right leg.
Sami went through Layla's stuff.
We thought you might want to come with us.
I have supported you throughout.
What were you doing when she came?
I'm not usually picky about food.
I don't think that Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
Please be so kind as to show me the way to the station.
Don't tickle me!
These pants don't fit me.
You're the biggest.
Just tell me what's going on.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
What is the name of this river?
He is stronger than me.
The toilet is upstairs.
Why doesn't he eat lunch with me anymore?
Let's hope that Mary can handle that by herself.
I've got one just like that.
I remember that.
She shot down a helicopter.
I feel bad for them.
Because she takes after her younger sister, I cannot tell one from the other.
Lazybones.
Again.
We've got something.
Wow!
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Where do you live?
The sky looks angry.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
The truth bears hatred.
Tom gave his seat to an elderly lady.
Why are you late?
Are you deaf?
Please get out of the kitchen.
Follow the stars.
I don't think like you.
Jesus hates you.
Tom, behind you!
Tom began to move.
Are you deaf?
About how many days will you be in Boston?
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do you speak English?
I don't know how to prove I wasn't in Boston.
I didn't want to do it.
Tom and Mary could've done that, but they didn't.
Sell!
Holy cow!
Enough!
When is school over?
It took me by surprise.
Tom has already taught me how to do that.
Answer!
The river overflowed.
Duh.
Watch yourself.
Jesus loves you.
Where would you like to go?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
When's dinner?
Yes.
She's with her dogs.
Pick it up.
We must work as long as we live.
Tom has found out Mary can't read.
Mary promised me that she'd do that before she went home.
Tom put on his sunglasses.
If they were Canadians, this problem wouldn't exist.
What's happening now in Poland?
Goodbye!
What is the name of this river?
What else is there?
I met him at a party.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
Are these your shoes?
Pull!
What are those called?
I went to Tokyo to buy this book.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
My butt hurts.
I don't like this paper. It's too shiny.
It's not blood. It's beet.
Tom asked me a lot of questions that I couldn't answer.
There's something that I've been wanting to ask you.
One more time, please.
We want what's best for you.
How did you get permission to do that?
He can't say one word of French, but then again he speaks English like a native.
Please try one.
How should I know?
Cows have horns.
You can go if you want to.
You're the biggest.
Don't repeat the same mistake!
Tom is going to hurt you.
Like master, like disciple.
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
Bear with me.
Jesus wept.
Look at the picture.
Blah.
Break the eggs and remove the yolks.
Where would you like to go?
Pull it open.
You drink tea.
Please try one.
Have you already bought your ticket?
Eat!
British and Japanese cars have steering wheels on the right side.
Tom lives in his own world.
Mary gave it to me before she died.
Tom didn't keep Mary waiting too long.
I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
Do you see the garden?
Fool!
Sometimes my dog barks in the middle of the night.
A telephone is more useful than a necklace.
I don't know if he has any special powers or not, but he's probably stronger than a normal human.
You seem to ask Tom a lot of questions.
The abuse of alcohol among young people is a serious problem.
Always.
Get out of my house!
You're just not the person I thought you were.
In fact, Tom told me never to come back to his house again.
People are speaking at the same time.
This sentence is mine.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
I don't want to go to school.
What are those called?
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
At the end of the sentence one should put a period.
Sit tight.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
It's too late to try that.
I'll do what must be done.
Who are you?
Tom fell down the stairs.
The storm sank the boat.
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me.
I'll figure out a way to fix this. Don't worry.
Recently.
He admitted that he was biased.
Tom and Mary are outside.
Are you deaf?
He has a bruise on his right leg.
What were you doing at that time?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
I'm very pleased to be here.
Eat fruits!
One more time.
What else?
You're the one who should pay the bill.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
She will give a party next week.
It took me by surprise.
Go.
He is sitting in the front seat.
They told us what they knew.
This is for me.
I don't know.
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
Hello!
Poor cat.
You should use a deodorant.
I didn't know why.
I haven't seen her for a long time.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Please try one.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
I think we need to find out where Tom and Mary are.
Have you washed your hands yet?
Mary said she thought Tom would be glad to see her.
He showed us how to ride a horse.
It's so good to take a rest after a long voyage.
But they are all people.
Dan's pitbull attacked Linda's small dog.
Who was taking care of Tom when this happened?
I'm pretty sure Tom can do it.
Tom asked me a lot of questions that I couldn't answer.
There's gum stuck to the back of my shoe.
Why can't animals talk?
Wash the dishes.
I'm learning Japanese.
Since when have you been learning Latin?
I thank you.
There are islands in the sea.
How should I know?
These pants don't fit me.
I'm pretty sure that Tom can do it.
He is one of the greatest scientists in the world.
How foolish!
Honestly...
Remember!
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
Where's the director?
They said they were afraid to go there.
He left all kinds of papers on his desk.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
Are these your shoes?
Have you ever been to Minnesota?
Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.
I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
The land is very fertile.
But why?
We eat together every evening.
We work for Tom.
Ow!
It's still breathing.
Please try one.
I understand why you're angry.
Watch out!
Where are you now?
Did you happen to see her yesterday?
How do people like you get to be people like you?
I love that chair.
Please try one.
Tom splashed Mary and she splashed him back.
He lost his job through his irresponsibility.
Are these your shoes?
Tom and Mary are very close.
You can't escape from me.
He couldn't do that by himself.
I'm sorry.
Are you sure?
The moon has set.
Did you get a good look at her?
Tell me where the wine is.
Where are you?
Farting is rude.
They said they were afraid to go there.
I take it as a sign of hope.
This is good.
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are the twelve months of the year.
I need this.
We've got something.
Quick!
Really!
I don't want anyone to see me with Tom.
Leave!
When will I get to see the effect of this soap?
Please.
It is the tallest tree that I ever saw.
I have a friend.
Stand aside.
Anyway.
I'm so hungry!
What is your name?
I have a friend.
I want you to kiss me.
Pull yourself together!
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me.
I'm going to Tom's office.
A pair of earrings is a nice present for her.
Are these your shoes?
Bye!
I'm going to Australia the month after next.
Tell me how you found out that I did that.
I'll see you at home.
I advised Tom not to waste his time trying to do that.
Done.
These pens are his.
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom and Mary weren't much help.
Come!
I'm so hungry!
She looked at me.
You can't escape from me.
This is a folding fan, and this is how you open it. It's for hot summer days.
Fry.
Study!
Poor cat.
What is 'terpomo'? An apple in the ground, or a potato?
Maybe.
Tom can't believe Mary is really planning to go.
Tom is the strongest.
Poor cat.
Tom went on a picnic with Mary and her family.
Will you please go there?
I know you have it with you.
I don't understand.
I love you.
I knew very little about him.
I like Chinese and Japanese.
"You slept with her!" "I did not."
Either skillful or lazy. But not both.
Listen.
Tom told Mary to try harder.
The toilet is upstairs.
My shoes are brown.
I want you, Tom.
Tom is going to hurt you.
My butt hurts.
Mary said that she wanted to die.
I told my parents everything.
All swans are white.
You don't know the system.
Where are you?
D.H. Lawrence is a novelist and poet.
What is your name?
About how many days will you be in Boston?
What do you do for the team?
Nuclear weapons are a threat to the race.
Hello!
Begin!
Help!
Tom threw a rock at one of my dogs.
Write!
Scram!
Achoo!
Mr. Tanaka can play the piano well.
Tom was kneeling.
Wash the dishes.
If I'd seen Mary yesterday, I would've talked to her.
Are you crazy?
They won't permit you to do that here.
I'll kick your butt!
Wait.
We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.
Where would you like to go?
"Let the English and the French take all the land they want," said the Indian chief. "But they want to take all the land between the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, is it OK?" said Tom.
Fuck!
What were you doing when she came?
You can go if you want to.
Out!
I think I may know where to find Tom.
The toilet is upstairs.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Pick it up.
This is difficult.
I knew very little about him.
Crazy!
I'm just joking.
I'm not eating this fish.
Why did you agree?
Crazy!
You're not the only one who's hungry.
I had to let her win.
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
Metal contracts when cooled.
Hurry up.
Tom hit me first.
You can't escape from me.
I've got one just like that.
I have a friend.
This is a paper ticket.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
You drink tea.
Tom didn't come home until 2:30.
I love you.
Have you ever been to Minnesota?
Who's your favorite Disney character?
Pick the one you like best.
Why don't I understand English?
This is not a cat. This is a dog.
It didn't work out quite like I intended it to.
Will you please explain to me the exact meaning of the word?
What are those?
Tom tried to kiss Mary, but she leaned back.
My house is very cold.
You guys have too much time on your hands.
You didn't break it.
Ned held the flag erect.
Farting is rude.
She puts the children to bed.
Mary gave it to me before she died.
Give Tom everything he asks for.
Hurry up.
It looks like Tom and Mary are home.
I want to fight.
Wash your face.
He kicked it.
The truth bears hatred.
English is not spoken here.
I tried to install a new browser.
Where else would I go?
I'm a Christian.
That is mine.
That's impossible.
Are you still able to speak your tribal language?
Want one?
His fart smelled.
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
You're just not the person I thought you were.
Tom, behind you!
He practices playing the guitar far into the night.
Why don't I understand English?
I was late, so I missed flight 501.
I wonder what Tom wants.
This is good.
There won't be a next time.
I lost my grandfather to cancer this year.
Quick!
Wash your hands.
You drink tea.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom here before.
These pens are his.
Whatever!
I don't know if Tom is coming or not.
Tom is way too young to be doing this.
Hurry up.
Jill looked at John sideways.
Bears can climb trees.
This account does not agree with the facts.
I know how to swim.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
I'm here because I have to be here.
He remained silent for a while.
Watch out!
Tom and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
I have two cats.
Your dreams are almost as twisted as my nightmares.
No.
Why do you think Tom and Mary are stupid?
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
Is there a tennis court around here?
Perfect!
I walked up the hill.
Hooray!
Fire!
Where is the ship?
Correct.
Stand still!
He gave the same answer as before.
I don't want to disturb you.
Have you already heard that he has finally returned home?
Give tea.
Tom is going to hurt you.
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Bear with me.
Tom is the strongest.
When is school over?
Take cover!
Thanks, everyone.
The sky brightened.
Therefore?
Smile!
You're just not the person I thought you were.
I don't want to know anything about Tom.
Tom and Mary can no longer do their jobs.
They want Tom back.
I'm here to stay.
Tom was my first Facebook friend.
Why?
I've been to Boston numerous times.
You must keep quiet.
There's one more.
A lot of people drowned when the ship sank.
Tom has asked Mary to help him.
Correct!
Shit.
Unbelievable!
Not everything Tom said was true.
Nonsense.
Do you want to come sit by me?
I think it is good that books still exist, but they do make me sleepy.
I didn't know why.
Thank you!
That news got around.
My car is parked over there.
I'll be right in here.
Tom got out of prison after 30 years.
Dead?
Poor cat.
How are we going to do that?
She invited me to eat.
He jumped over a ditch.
Tom lives alone with his dog.
Stand aside.
I remember that.
She knows that as well.
Moreover, when viewed from the side, the front teeth are protruding.
Ask Tom what his plans are.
Why aren't they here?
Likewise.
Idiot!
Tom borrowed some money from us.
I didn't pick it up.
Sami was never respectful to me.
It didn't go well.
What is your name?
What is your name?
Cows give us milk.
How cute!
How long do we have to wait here?
You drink tea.
The land is very fertile.
I'll get him to carry this box upstairs.
Tom wants you.
Tom smiled when Mary looked at him.
Tom won the election.
I had already eaten before I arrived at the party.
Are you deaf?
I didn't give Tom anything.
He is lying on the baby.
Tom smiled when Mary looked at him.
What are those numbers?
Where's the director?
They already know what they'll do.
He is eight.
Wash the dishes.
He had the right to defend himself.
What were you doing at that time?
I just want him to go away.
The toilet is upstairs.
What?
Goodbye!
Tom and Mary are outside.
Tom was the first one to volunteer to help us.
It's impossible to fix.
Read this first.
Should we try to help?
I just laughed because everyone else did.
I can't decide which route to take to Boston.
I've always hated her.
She looked at me.
You can't escape from me.
Pass me the pen.
She is a very beautiful woman.
There is no necessity for you to do that.
She loves to cook.
It needs washing.
Tom is the only one who really knows what to do.
You can't escape from me.
Tom and Mary own the house up the street.
Beware!
Would you mind calling Tom for me?
They could've done it by themselves.
How wonderful!
Tom and Mary looked like they hadn't slept in days.
Louder.
There are only books on the shelf.
I am coming.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
You didn't know Mary was supposed to do that by herself, did you?
What do you want?
I've been up all night writing.
Hello.
Of course.
Stars are beautiful.
Where is the toilet?
Sing!
Tom and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
She picked flowers.
Mary tried to protect her kids.
There were once a King and a Queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, who was very strong and active, and good-looking.
I didn't drink the water.
Do you know who Tom's mother is?
They're all scared of Tom.
A drop of sweat ran down his temple.
Tom never saw Mary.
He spoke to me when he saw me.
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom put his arm around Mary and kissed her cheek.
He is in need of money.
I don't like this paper. It's too shiny.
Sami needs to trust Layla.
Pardon me, but that is my racket.
You don't have to go to school tomorrow.
I saw the hill.
I want to rent a car, please show me a price list.
Tom didn't come home until 2:30.
Wash the dishes.
Kiss my ass.
The hill is always green.
Do you have time tomorrow?
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
The one hundred metre run starts at two in the afternoon.
Here lives one bear.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
Tom is the only one who really knows what to do.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
How old are you?
What do you want?
I don't think like you.
Tom is liked by his friends.
She teased him.
Watch out!
Mother Earth.
This is difficult.
This is difficult.
Mary hastily packed her suitcase.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
We speak Japanese.
There's one more.
Sami is not afraid of the jungle.
Tom hired me to paint his house.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
Tokyo is bigger than Yokohama.
Walk.
Mary threw Tom under the bus.
Tom and Mary said they wished they could do that as well as John.
Hey.
Take the other chair!
What are those called?
What are those called?
Tom wants answers.
Pack your bags.
One day, she told me that she wanted a pet cat.
You're not the only one who's hungry.
Are these your shoes?
When does it begin?
That hurts.
I had to let her win.
We've got something.
Nonsense!
Did you have a good sleep?
Who's hungry?
Why don't you like me?
She picked flowers.
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
Speak softly.
When was that?
I feel like shit.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Pass me the pen.
He likes to smoke while taking a shit.
Alright.
Ouch!
You can't escape from me.
Can you hear me?
For me it was a question of life or death.
Pack your bags.
Speak!
Tom looks sad.
When is your birthday?
Tom didn't tell anybody he wanted to do that.
This belongs to me.
The truth bears hatred.
It's hot.
I remember that.
She said that she was full.
Very!
This chair is ugly.
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
Sami's wife was there.
Cows eat grass.
Tom told Mary that he didn't know how to play the saxophone.
Do you speak English?
That hurts.
Mary doesn't like her new sofa.
She wrote me a long letter.
She never saw her sister again.
Why do you always ask so many questions?
The earth rotates.
Fuck!
I did not hear you.
Speak softly.
It is raining.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
I no longer need a loan.
How do you use this camera?
I love you.
It's hot today.
Eat noodles.
She teased him.
Are you deaf?
You can go if you want to.
Read this first.
She said she wanted to marry me.
So?
Nowadays no one believes in ghosts.
Tom, behind you!
Pray.
I have dandruff.
Cows give us milk.
Sami smoked weed before he joined the military.
Sami was watching this video.
This chair is light.
I know Tom and Mary are going to hate this.
We'll fail.
What is your name?
We often do what we have to do, not what we want to do.
How do you know Tom is there?
I don't think like you.
What is your name?
Jump.
Where would you like to go?
Wash your hands.
What are you doing?
Bye!
They exchanged hellos.
How should I know?
You didn't break it.
I didn't give Tom anything.
He thanked me with his eyes.
Tom is the strongest.
Kneel!
Who runs the fastest of the three?
I'm not sure who has my suitcases.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
They said they were afraid to go there.
You can go if you want to.
What'll change?
Tom, behind you!
Here?
I still can't remember the words to that song.
Understood?
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
Tom said that he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
I will do it.
Tom is still paying attention.
Thank you very much!
Chill.
Don't you think it strange that he is not here?
Look behind you.
Stand aside.
Leave!
Tom said it was all like a dream.
Tom wanted Mary to go away.
He is lying on the baby.
Look behind you.
She picked flowers.
What is your name?
Tom tried to restart the car, but couldn't.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
What is the name of this river?
Tom, behind you!
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Don't tickle me!
Tom and Mary still don't know who John is.
I'd visit Boston if I were you.
She picked flowers.
Because it is there.
I eat.
Yes.
Tom will die without your help.
Goodbye!
They haven't finished their lunch yet.
Leave it behind.
Tom and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
Eat everything.
There's one more.
Very good, thank you.
Scram!
Please keep your voice down.
You agree with Tom, right?
She was wearing a fur coat.
You're very fast at putting my sentences there.
It'd be about time to reply to his letter.
Where are you?
He demoted you.
Tom said he didn't remember much.
I know we can take care of ourselves if we try.
Quieter!
It's hot.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
Read this book.
We thought you might want to come with us.
A long time ago when Pluto was still a planet, there was a boy named Tom.
Tom, behind you!
She lied to protect her family.
I'm going to Australia the month after next.
Please try one.
Is Tom in surgery?
Are you deaf?
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Why does this have to be done?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
It's still crowded.
The stars came out.
All swans are white.
Want one?
Most Japanese temples are made of wood.
What were you doing at that time?
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
Tom has lots of friends in Australia.
Because she felt sick.
Tom's phone rang.
Who are you?
Sleep!
Aren't you going to give me a kiss?
How are you?
Pretty!
Tom soon caught up with Mary.
