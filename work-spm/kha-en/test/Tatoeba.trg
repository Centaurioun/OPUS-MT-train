Bearing can be unbearable.
I have an erection.
Tom hasn't been swimming in a long time.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think John really needed to do that today.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
The bear bites itself.
It is not raining.
He leaves at eight.
You can't escape from me.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
We must work as long as we live.
The forest was covered with snow and the evenings were quiet as animals slept through the cold winter nights.
All swans are white.
Everyone has been affected.
Tom has lots of friends.
She's got a fair complexion while her brother is very dark.
I can't get anything right.
Tell me where the wine is.
My car's in the garage.
It was me who killed Kennedy.
Where is the toilet?
It's really annoying.
It didn't go well.
Quiet!
I need this.
Emily hates toilets.
Whose are these pens?
What?
No.
I am eating rice.
Why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors?
I just need some aspirin.
Does anybody hear me?
I just want to forget about it.
I don't have any children yet.
You can go if you want to.
Cover your eyes.
I remember that.
Are you crazy?
Coffee gives you energy!
They said they were afraid to go there.
Pack your bags.
Idiot!
I didn't even have time to paint!
Give me a piece of chalk.
How weird is that?
We must leave immediately.
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
You can't afford this.
Her mother lives in the country all by herself.
Tom quickly opened the drawer and pulled out a gun.
Tom fell off the truck while he was feeding the reindeer.
Tom, behind you!
What?
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Stand still!
What languages do you know?
Wash your face.
Friend me on Facebook. Huh, what's that? Really, so you don't do Facebook? You must not have any friends. That's terrible.
I called at his office yesterday.
Play!
Each of them has his own car.
Did anybody come?
That was unfortunate.
Mary cut up all the pictures she had of Tom.
Don't worry.
Louder.
He was drunk and forgot to shut the back door.
My name's Tom.
Mary said that she wouldn't do it.
When the house caught fire, an awful feeling came over me.
Why do you need a new television?
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
I have no energy.
Whatever!
We'll fail.
He demoted you.
Please sit.
Play!
See you tomorrow.
Do I have to make a speech?
Tom was even busier than I was.
It's hot today.
I gave it my best shot.
How do you take off the shell of a boiled egg cleanly? Is there some sort of trick?
We live on Earth.
She chatted with her friends about the baseball game.
Ouch!
Finally!
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
Watch.
Watch the road.
My shoes are brown.
We'll go to any length to send our child to a good university.
Push.
What languages do you know?
You drink tea.
Anger is an energy.
The leader should know where to set up the tent.
What were you doing at that time?
You're welcome.
He stood there for a while.
Goodnight!
Will you guys please stop fighting?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
How could this sort of thing possibly happen?
It's too hot.
Enter!
You can tell me tomorrow.
Can you hear me?
I would like you to sing a song.
I want to go back to my friends.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
These pants don't fit me.
Stop. That tickles.
I was jealous of you.
I am.
I don't know how to swim.
I'll see you at home.
I can't put up with Tom's bad manners any longer.
I'll see you at home.
The behavior did his reputation no good.
I don't want to go to school.
I don't remember if Tom lent me the book or if I borrowed it from the library.
You can't escape from me.
We're going to help her.
No.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
This is for me.
Since when?
I'm not going to go back.
Help me.
I've always hated her.
You haven't even tried.
What's your name?
Hurry up.
Do you know how much profit we made?
Where is the toilet?
Wrong.
Tom must've been very disappointed.
It's all you can really do.
Tom doesn't realise how his behaviour affects others.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
Choose one.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
Stop!
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
There is no necessity for you to do that.
You can't escape from me.
Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.
They pretended they were afraid.
Want one?
Eat slowly.
They won't permit you to do that here.
Look behind you.
You're very fast at putting my sentences there.
Right?
It's raining.
Tom and Mary said they didn't think they could do that now.
I'm sorry.
I'm just asking.
I was looking for the barbershop.
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine.
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
Bring tea.
I'm not going to tell them that.
How are your studies going?
What were you doing when she came?
Cows live on grass.
I'm not calling you by name.
I know you have an essay to write.
I didn't vote for you.
Sorry.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
Remember!
Did anybody come?
Me!
Jesus Christ!
Tom has found out Mary can't read.
It used to be such fun.
Mary says she's not busy tomorrow.
Eat everything.
Very good, thank you.
He left without having shut the door.
Do you like the movie?
You can't escape from me.
Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.
"Remember your promise!" "Don't worry! I can keep a secret!"
Yummy!
How are we going to do that?
Choose one.
What were you doing when she came?
Tom, behind you!
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
I saw Tom running down the street.
Look!
Poor cat.
I'm not sure who has my suitcases.
I'm losing business.
You really do ask a lot of questions, don't you?
This is difficult.
Ow!
Now, I write with the new font.
They live downstairs.
Love the earth.
Just get up.
Mary grabbed her coat and left.
Why don't we play tennis on Sunday?
Are these your shoes?
Fly!
I don't want to know anything about that.
I just got up.
Thank you, Jesus.
Where would you like to go?
He said he needs to go shopping.
What are those?
He's closed-minded.
A mother rabbit keeps her babies warm with her own body.
Is there something you want to ask me for?
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
I didn't pick it up.
You can't escape from me.
Please cover yourself.
It won't fly!
She strangled a cat.
Pick the one you like best.
He has ten cows.
It's a waste of time and a waste of money.
What were you doing at that time?
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
Tom and Mary don't want to retire.
Sami is a good dad.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Give Tom everything he asks for.
Who runs the fastest of the three?
Tom put his pistol under the pillow.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
Duh.
Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
Tom fell off his mother's lap.
Mary misled you.
I heard that he could even translate from Ancient Hebrew.
If you know the answer to this question, please tell me.
I had just put it before you ask me to.
How do people like you get to be people like you?
Whose are these pens?
We should give this a try.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
Look behind you.
Fight!
Idiot!
Tom and Mary don't know that I wish they'd leave.
I didn't say that. That's your interpretation.
Are you crazy?
You can go if you want to.
My guess is that Tom isn't going to want that.
Quick!
This is difficult.
I've got one just like that.
Not everything Tom said was true.
Fight!
Jump.
It's too hot.
Where is the toilet?
It's too late to try that.
Poor cat.
How do you know Tom is there?
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
Correct!
She folded the quilt.
I had a suspicion that he would leave me.
Go.
Here?
The situation is worse than we believed.
If not now, when?
He arrived here just now.
Run!
Tom handed the photo album to Mary.
How smart!
We could say that both of those balls are the same weight.
What is your name?
Tom knows about this, doesn't he?
Tom, behind you!
What is wrong with me?
Tom, behind you!
Try!
You should probably buy a ticket for Tom, too.
He is lying on the baby.
Very!
How do people like you get to be people like you?
Germany is a cold country.
Hi.
That book is a new book.
What else are you planning to do?
I am learning Japanese.
Leave!
Read this first.
Strange.
He is tall and strong.
What're they doing?
Yes.
That was really sweet.
Eat everything.
Don't tell a lie. Be honest.
If possible, I'd like to read more about the issue.
It is very cold today.
The moon is shining.
Tom and Mary won't allow dogs in their houses.
This is difficult.
Goodbye!
Sami forced Layla to lie.
A river flows.
We are going to the market.
Does anyone know where Tom and Mary are?
