# Translate data as synthetic training data

Use Wiki data:

* json processor: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
* wiki JSON dumps: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/cirrussearch/current/

NOTE: this only works for SentencePiece models


## TODO

*  download base models from ObjectStorage
*  make it work with multilingual models (need to adjust preprocess-scripts for those models)
